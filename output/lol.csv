Jensen with the 6 vision score lmfao,1
"Don't forget guys, TL is NA's best chance at making it out of groups.",1
ENDER WTF IS THAT IN YOUR EAR,1
"Sorry Jensen, but 6 vision score in a 22 minute game is criminally bad.",1
"Literally nothing happening  and we miss the bot lane fight, just fly the LEC observers in the ones they’re are using just arnt good enough",1
"Jensen, time to retire.",1
" As an European it was always hard for me to understand American culture. What was fascinating for me is that they like bragging about their freedom which was weird for me, because I didn't think that I have any less freedom than them. I always thought 'What is the difference'. However after this game I finally understand it. NA is just so fucking free.",1
"""Mastercard Gold Graph"" ""Red Bull Baron Buff""

How more fucking American can this stream get",1
"""i love NA but i'm gonna be realistic and put them all 3rd in their groups"" - yeah, no, next year i'm putting every single one of them last.",1
glad that flowers and azael are calling out tl. it´s inexcusable,1
So TL is basically CoreyJJ and Tactical?,1
"Oof, playing Phoenix before a G2 game.

Are the script writers taunting us?",1
At the pace Ender is levelling up his earrings I can’t wait to see what it looks like by finals,1
Imagine Caps vs Jensen. Im already worried about Jensen.,1
"My picks are doomed, I should never have put faith in NA teams.",1
Jensen might as well have been afk. Absolutely zero impact.,1
imagine being the guy who took a week off work and stays up to watch NA shit the bed again... Def wouldn't wanna be that guy hehehe...Sadge,1
"Phoenix playing before G2 plays lmao, Riot pls",1
Unpopular opinion: Flyquest was the best looking LCS team so far. They did loose quite hard but at least they were proactive. TSM and liquid pretty much just rolled over.,1
"Every year NA gets hyped, every year it’s the same result. I think TL is gonna lose and NA will start 0-3 lol",1
Jensen getting a salary for farming under turret as orianna for 37 minutes lmao.,1
"Who could have predicted ""do nothing and wait for opponents to make mistakes"" won't work vs good opponents, ah well nevertheless... can't wait for TL to run it back again next year.",1
TL just another over rated play ins team \~,1
That look on Broxas face: We are gonna lose this group.,1
Someone tell TL this is not Play Ins anymore.,1
lads my house is currently the biggest salt mine in the world if your in cali stop by for free salt.,1
"look i know he's 33 years old and a consummate professional, but every time i see jatt i think 'pure sweet lil angel baby'",1
"Syndra's farm is actually illegal.

Also, Caedral please come back and commentate.",1
"Jensen and getting mid diffed, name a more iconic worlds duo",1
"Machi looks good at this slow plays style. Might be more interesting group then people initially predicted. I want to see how they look when tempo of the game is faster, this looks like their comfort zone.",1
Wow...didn't know Jensen can play Evelynn mid /s,1
TL HAVE DONE NOTHING INTELLIGENTLY PROACTIVE IN THE NEUTRAL GAME FOR THE LAST 25 MINUTES,1
cannot wait for Thank you Jensen video next week.,1
"Step 1: Play back and scale

Step 2: Never fight

Step 3: ???

Step 4: Lose",1
Jensen straight up just useless this game,1
"15 cs away from a flame horizon btw, Mission ended with 418 cs",1
So can we all agree NA is lucky to have 3 seeds?,1
before we start blaming Broxah like dumb casters.. Graves should farm early game...,1
Casters somehow surprised that Volibear has a more active early game than a Graves...,1
TL will often bore the other team to a loss.,1
Mission has ridonculous CS,1
"Yesterday we had a 402 cs game, but no mastercard drop. I will keep track of the unofficial gold digger. Mission seems like a serious contender.",1
"I think I saw it being said below, but how is Jensen 8 vision score in 30 min game??????",1
TL are going to fuck up my pickems.,1
No engages against an Ezreal lmao,1
"Absolutely huge statement game from Machi. Hope they can keep up the pace through the rest of groups, a pleasure to watch",1
"I was gonna stay up for the TSM game, but the way NA is playing I don't think it's gonna be worth ruining my sleep schedule",1
"Holy fck, TL didnt try ANYTHING at any point in the game. The draft was sht, but that was just do sad, their style is awful",1
Lmao. Thanks Jensen. I knew Machi would win because of you.,1
Will NA win any games in group stage?,1
"Real talk, Phoenix is such an underrated worlds song and so is Worlds Collide",1
none of you saw anything.... ANYTHING,1
Common TL let's both advance and meet in final !,1
Me getting out of bed on a Sunday to watch worlds: RISE! RISE! RIIIIISE!,1
[lmao](https://puu.sh/Gzjyn/0e92c09968.png) I love TL's twitter,1
Bruh they dead ass gave TL Graves,1
do i smell jg diff,1
why na pbp casters shout that much when nothing hype is happening,1
"Mission's CS lead, jesus",1
jensen losing lane vs mission. I can't wait till he has to play caps,1
Broxah playing all the Farmville he can before Facebook shuts it down.,1
182 CS at 16 mins. What the fuck.,1
Fuckin 200cs at 17 minutes is insane on the worlds stage,1
"Somewhere, Wolf is incredibly angry",1
Worldclass midlaner,1
What the hell is this mid gap? I know Jensen sucks and has become budget Bjerg but this is sad.,1
Huge Mid-jg gap. Jensen getting clapped again by an LMS midlaner.,1
"I fell like people gonna blame Broxah again, when both Jensen and Impact didn't think they need to ward in the first 4 min and both goth ganked.",1
"Thst ez shifting into everyone, pretty ballsy.",1
"Damn, Bruce has big balls",1
I feel like I've been watching NA teams do nothing and lose for like 8 years in a row now,1
"This sucks ): I know we get told NA sucks all year but for some reason I always get really hopeful every year that a NA will shock everyone and do something  amazing like C9 when they got to semi

It’s honestly depressing",1
damn this wasnt even close at any point,1
"Team diff, gg.",1
huge mid/jg diff this game,1
Road to 0-18,1
"TL got hard outplayed that game, that was just a team diff.",1
Machi proving why they are PCS's 1st seed.,1
LCS 2021: Welcome back Jatt!,1
pretty much how all NA fans feel now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bagCFX_Guw,1
"TSM will go 0-6 and on the last game as the nexus explodes bjergsen will walk over to doublelift and suplex him into the opposing team booth, taking them out of worlds",1
"G2 smiling. Yes, this is good.",1
"Ocelote:  ""With all the respect, the main problem of g2 is going from playing vs DWG, JDg or TOP and come back to EU to play vs Excel"" Lmao",1
"Azael is really hard to listen to.

TL gets a kill in bot: ""WELCOME TO GROUPS BABY""

Jensen dies in mid 5 seconds later: ""Oh no how could this happen?""",1
Do you think Doinb will become a coach for some pro team?,1
RGE vs.DWG finals preview,1
Sjokz wardrobe is always so nice,1
The color of Yamato's eyes really pop with the studio lighting.,1
Nice of Froskurinn to lend her wardrobe to Ender,1
LUX SUPPORT LET'S GO,1
"Lux support at worlds, those silver supports were right all those years",1
saving flash for next worlds,1
Oh no it's happening.,1
"Everyone saying TL got what they wanted in draft but Machi definitely went in with a plan, they were clearly watching TL playins and didn't want them having cross-map potential.",1
mission outperforming jensen heavily,1
Machi's jungler actually looks so good this game.,1
"teams taking turns exchanging objective, seems more like all 10 players playing on the same team with procativity being the opponent",1
Does Syndra hold some sort of psychological weight when facing Jensen or something.,1
"Can we get some fucking stats?

I feel like all the people talking about LCK being slow are talking out of their ass.",1
Jensen is probably the worst midlaner at worlds,1
Bye NA,1
"Considering PSG talon was pretty good, it's not surprising Machi are even better.",1
Voli being in jungle and succeeding gives hope to Jankos tbh 😂,1
How the fuck is jensen's vision score that bad? lol,1
Lmao only NA teams can be given comfort picks and still loses :(,1
TL is so bad,1
"Okay, this is actually sad to watch, Go next.",1
Jensen is getting outclassed hard since minions spawned.,1
"Very unimpressed by Broxah, he is *soooo passive*. The difference this game was the Machi jungler actually went for ganks. He is 50CS up on Gemini, but he's done nothing with it.",1
"TL is just doing nothing. they just lay down since min 1 and say „here master machi do as you please“. 
how can you be so frikken damn passive. like wtf are you expecting. machi saying ok here you can now win.",1
"Broxah hard stomping jungle, he is up 40 cs /s",1
Btw guys what happened to Jensen? Why's he not playing?,1
This is the most embarrassing game of worlds so far.,1
"TL strat every game:

1. Pick comfort
2. Play better individually
3. Rely on Broxah smite steal if #2 doesn't work
4. ...",1
"Another year where NA doesn't realize you need to risk it for the biscuit. You gotta take shots to make shots.

Really wish C9 was here because atleast they would throw haymakers.",1
NA goes 0-18 this year. mark my words.,1
Absolute awful draft TL literally has 0 engage.,1
The fuck is TL doing. They just give everything,1
Has Jensen even ulted a single time this game???,1
Hi newbie here. Want to be degen better on this but don't even understand the basics. How does a team win? Most towers? Most kills? Can someone please explain?,1
"This draft would've only worked when they got ahead... Which they didn't, so now either Machi has to duck up gracefully, or TL can't do shit.

Eh, it's kind of over now eh?",1
"TL finally found their nemesis, a team which drafts and plays even slower than them. You can't bore these guys to death till you finally win, TL!",1
God I hate being a fan of this dogshit region.,1
Wtf are these cs numbers? Did they even miss a single minion?,1
Jensen solo losing the game where’s your emote spam now buddy,1
Pls Jensen's ori is just so passive and gross.,1
Are you kidding me TL? wtf!!!!??,1
Its all fun and game until NA loses their third place to VN or HK/TW/SEA,1
I actually feel bad for NA now.,1
Broxah hard farms for 20 minutes while Jensen and Impact get daddy dcked by voli to do absolutely nothing late game.,1
Shouldn't we get a drop for 400cs?,1
Damn. Mission and Bruce going DoinB mode with those farm score.,1
I feel bad for NA fans ruining their sleep schedule for this,1
"Silver 3 team draft.   
""no i dont want to play a tank""

""well neither do i""

""soz dont have the runes for a tank""",1
How did FLY look more competitive versus TES than TL did versus Machi?,1
im feeling a G2 lose here I have to say. Its too early in the tournament for G2 to perform,1
"Warriors, Phoenix, Rise  

The holy trinity of WORLDS songs",1
G2.. please no heart attacks.,1
Why would you try to ban out Wunder?,1
Pick FPX Lee Sin skin and it's won for Suning,1
"Good job OP. Imagine the shame, if you made it Day 1 twice.",1
Being an NA fan is an abusive relationship. Every year they say they changed. Every year they do just enough to give you a bit of hope. Then shit like this happens and they wonder why you don’t have any faith in them.,1
"G2 always give me anxiety, the highest of high ceiling but will troll random games",1
0-18 is alive for NA,1
The Red Bull Baron buff... really? I'm gonna be sick,1
The redbull baron buff? Lmao,1
am i the only one who thinks ender earring looks good? ppl are trashing him in chat,1
"Ender looking like fresh to death, dude",1
"Covid hits hard, i guess. Phreaks beard and flowers mullet is the living proof of it.",1
Imagine giving Broxah the one champ he doesn’t lose on,1
"Does teams even do prep vs. TL?

They always get exactly what they want.",1
Brother Jensen,1
Jensen worlds form,1
jensen PLEASE,1
Jensen saving flash for next year,1
Keeping Flash for worlds 2021,1
Has Jensen flashed a level 2 gank in his life?,1
Wait this Voli is not useless how come,1
"Just tuning in, TL still got Graves lol wtf Machi",1
Jensen down a kill and 20 CS isn't a good look for the rest of this group's matches...,1
"Another Worlds, another time Jensen gets mid gaped by some random player. Lmao at the people claiming he's world class every year.",1
might be a bit early to say so but jungle diff,1
i wonder if impact told jensen to look at him before he flashed the voli flash right there,1
Mission on a mission.,1
"TL is actually hard fucked if Jensen can't even keep up with Mission.

Like what do they do if they ever play against Knight or Chovy (I know them even getting that far is unlikely but)",1
Mission is legit insane when it comes to farming.,1
Mission the CS machine.,1
reminds me of jensen orianna vs AHQ last worlds,1
Broxah is getting gapped so hard holy,1
Looks like a bit of a diffy in the jiffy,1
"Jensen needs to play with more respect to these teams. He recalls in front of a turret so he can get plate gold and dies during play-ins, and both of his deaths are just disrespect. He never does this in LCS and it seems like he has it in his mind that it’s wildcard.",1
"83 vision score 22 mins in. Holy shit, CoreJJ",1
Jensen about the get flamehorizoned,1
IMPACT? What the fuck. Botside had recalled and Graves was topside. What the fuck was that. What the fuck are TL doing,1
Poor Koala dying from random splash damage lmao,1
Are we gonna get that 450 CS drop perhaps? Hold on TL! We need them drops baybay,1
"barooooon go barrrooooon, my goodness GG G2 and SN these teams are too passive",1
Man TL look so off compared to last week.,1
"I didn’t know anything about Machi coming into Worlds, but they’re looking kinda good",1
"ON THE PLUS SIDE, TL only 1k gold down. Still winnable imo. Just need the perfect fight",1
"yea....if i was an na fan , id go back to sleep right about now",1
I just saw Jensen let out a big sigh. Tilt is ebbing in.,1
Upgraded Luden's Pog,1
Wtf man TL do something!,1
"Good ole’ TSM special, free baron lmao",1
Ornn not being permad is pretty troll tbh,1
RIP PICKEMS,1
"Why not FF when you're not going to be doing anything all game?

Although to be fair cloud soul is the least bad one to give over.",1
"Why aren't they doing anything.

At least try.",1
"g2 and suning will eat TL alive, tsm is the only NA hope",1
TL is just getting shredded. Not sure if this is a PCS uprising or the gap between CN/KR/EU and NA has gotten even wider,1
TL acting like MCX has corona. Just afraid to get anywhere near them all game.,1
"I'm not going to trust an NA team again in my pick ems, I was really hopefull for Core and Impact",1
"Why is Jensen greeting paid 1m+ salary when even an unknown more talented midlaner like Mission exist lmao. Probably more exist 

Twice now he is clapped by an LMS midlaner.",1
TL aka Time Liability is an north american organization who's better known for doing nothing in the game and wait for the enemy to crush their base,1
tfw you predict TL 4th,1
 S*o this is how NA dies* . . . *with thunderous applause*,1
"At least TSM had very fixable mistakes and put up a fight, heck even FLY didn’t look 100% awful and bad moments. But TL just is sitting around dying. Need some big adjustments moving forward",1
I preferred watching Flyquest. At least they did something.,1
Did Jensen disconnect this game?,1
Bruce 1 man army lol and TL ofc can't do anything. How fucked is your draft when ezreal e's forward alone?,1
Mission zoning entirety of TL by himself lol,1
"At least i set my expectations rock bottom, so i expected this. I fucking hate NA.",1
"This Syndra just gets to 1v5, outranges everyone.",1
"Worst draft of Worlds 2020
2nd baron just killed in front of them",1
Jensen is literally garbage. He's the worst midlaner in his group just like last year.,1
My pickem is saved. Thank Mr.Liquid!,1
Awful league of legends from Jensen,1
Thank God this shit is over,1
Ornns been so busted since the sunfire cape changes,1
"Mission 1 Q takes half of Tactical's health, there's no way he can carry TL this game",1
Can... can I change my pick 'ems?,1
Broxah in complete disbelieve of the draft,1
"Group A exposed, just imagine how bad teams were in group A from play ins lol.",1
"not banning Ornn was a huge mistake, who would've thought",1
Literally looked like old school LCK League of Legends. Beautiful.,1
One of the worst drafts i have seen lately,1
"That was kind of embarrassing. They were hovering around 2k gold behind a lot of the game, and at times it seemed much more than that.",1
Who would of thought Playins and Group stage were completely different huh NA.,1
Dumb to have any slight faith in NA by putting TL and TSM 3rd in pickems. Fuck.,1
"I don't like that draft into Ornn and voli. It literally requires Machi to misplay repeatedly.

Its so disrespectful at this level. I don't understand what TL is doing. Please fix this and they can still get out of groups, but if this is how they will look the entire time, its RIP for TL.",1
"""We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas!""",1
"""Mercedes drive to victory"" please stop this cringe",1
TL are gonna fuck my pick ems by not coming third aren't they,1
"TL: ""We're going to draft a farm jungler.""

Machi: ""Okay, are you going to draft engage tools with that to enable your farming jungler?""

TL: ""LMAO NO. Lux and Mordekaiser please.""",1
"At least TSM put up something of a fight against FNC, wtf is this TL",1
"Jensen did nothing with his TP, not even to get early lane pressure. 

Core just doesn't look that good without being on an engage support.

Gemini ganks both solo lanes while Broxah is always being spotted by/clearing out wards. Gemini/MCX gets all neutral objectives and had superior map pressure and vision control.

TL draft was crap and had no choice but to just... ""play to not lose"" rather than to win. I don't think they knew their win condition; perhaps they didn't have one. 

Farming until 40 mins with 6 items is of the past. There is such a thing as Dragon Soul and Baron...",1
Let's go G2!,1
Wonder how G2 will play this worlds meta.,1
Seeing Caps smile across the table at his teammates is heartwarming.,1
https://twitter.com/Cloud9/status/1312681882551611392,1
"Imagine posting these types of memes from your couch when your team went 2-4 last year.

https://twitter.com/Cloud9/status/1312681882551611392",1
Miky shaved himself,1
G2 win this game. That Tf will win the game,1
Both teams have ith good drafts. This will hopefully a good match.,1
"let's see if jankos will be as useless as broxah, his team brought some engage at least",1
"Muay thai Lee Sin  

PROJECT: Ashe  

Yep, this is a pro game alright",1
"In true NA fashion, TL will be eliminated and then beat Suning when it couldn't matter less. 

Absolutely horrendous game.",1
Watching NA  is so soul crushing I miss C9,1
"I can predict the NA offseason: all three teams humiliated at worlds this year, everyone comes out and says “we have to get better, we will get better” only to continue making the same mistakes.

If riot wasn’t an NA company, NA would be sending 1 team to worlds.",1
"So TL gets to play only on the second day, their group has a PCS team and their first game is against said team and they get Morde, Graves and Ori.

The blessings of being 3rd seed are bountiful indeed.",1
"MAD sacrificed themselves to make NA think they had a chance, just for the megalulz. Well played, EU",1
Remember when people thought TL would get out of groups after play ins lmao,1
"This might end up being the last year I watch LoL Esports as an NA fan. I'm about tired of this shitshow of a region.

Its 100% lack of practice. Everyone comes to LA to chill and take vacations and collect checks, hardly practice(looking at you 40 solo Q games Solo), hardly play the game, and just shit on our region.

I'd 100% rather watch 6 academy rookies go out there and get shit on any day of the week then watch world champs, EU stars, check collectors, and all that shit take our money and put up performances like that.

And Fk doublelift.",1
Ender looking like Ben Stiller in There’s Something About Mary...think about it,1
"Good morning, ladies and gents.",1
"fly-quest got hard out-skilled, but made some plays and kept it scrappy. TSM was the exact opposite: got hard out-macro'd, but didn't seem out-skilled. part of the reason they're so incredibly depressing to watch always. i *genuinely* believe the skill is there to hang with some great teams, but the brains sure aren't. it's no wonder the coaching staff has been catching flack for - lemme check - as long as coaching staffs have been a thing. are they *ever* gonna do anything about it?",1
I'm really worried for G2 with this jungle meta,1
I think i’ve heard every Worlds song on stream except for the new Worlds song lol,1
"By the power bequeathed by ender's earring, tsm and TL will both win today, NAmen",1
Ender Bling Bling 💍,1
Rogue upsetting DWG incoming,1
Sjokz back at it again looking perfect and shit,1
"Is it me, or those statefarm ads etc are kinda annoying?",1
Flowers! POG,1
"""TL jatt"" being a real thing is still strange to see",1
Koala. Nice. Aussies still in the game.,1
TL getting literally everything they want so far. God I hope we don't get NA 0-3 to start.,1
[If someone wants the champ select music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4GSWM6KiQA),1
"How is Broxah his tiny champion pool never getting pressured, makes no sense.",1
"Digging how they put the region and seed on the pick/ban, cool addition.",1
Broxah about to set a record by playing only Graves for the rest of worlds.,1
I’m disgusted by the toxicity in twitch chat ):,1
"I'm from EU but I like the boys from TL. So good luck brother Broxah, let's win this!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: never thrust NA",1
Jensen's trolling xd,1
Jensen just flash it pleeeease,1
"I think Jensen thought the Voli Q would run out, it was extremely close.",1
"oh no, NA's only world class midlaner is down due to not respecting with a flash.",1
NA and saving flash. It hurts.,1
insert Wolf clip of Jensen,1
Top died,1
Jungle diff incoming,1
"Damn, two really nice ganks. Machi’s looking good so far! Has me a little excited!",1
getting mid gapped by MCX lmfao,1
??????? Why didnt Voli and Syndra killed broxah there what the fuck lmao,1
Broxah rly lucky there. Goddamn.,1
Lackluster showing so far but TL's still set to win,1
Is Ezrael a good match-up into Caitlyn?,1
"Damn. I know they got the early kill mid but should that lead to Syndra getting 20-30cs lead?

**Sandra",1
holy thats such a passive game,1
Jensen getting styled on,1
"Ornn manhandling bruisers toplane, as usual.",1
Jensen and disappearing at worlds. Name a better duo.,1
"Machi really showing up with the Map control and pressure, TL is finally finding an opponent fighting back.",1
Mid diff,1
Jensen getting gapped rip,1
"Machi's map control is unf.

This is not looking good for TL. Impact need to overperform.",1
"will mission actually flame horizon him?  
also Machi is a good team so far",1
vision canyon,1
"kinda amazed Tactical outlived syndra burst

took literally everything for him to live at like 300 hp, though",1
How does vision score work? Is it wards placed or?,1
When you see CoreJJ vision and Biofrost yesterday lmao,1
"Jensen could be playing better, but he's laning 1v2 this game tbf

TL desperately needs a good jungler though",1
I hate this ori build. Please stick with ludens dethcap,1
Corejj vision score @ 22m wtf is that..,1
Broxah is a walking ward,1
TL overrated. Machi kinda good,1
Love a little siesta to wake up calmly before G2 - Suning,1
Bruce on that player cam looks like he is gonna straight up stab a mothefucker,1
this is not looking good for TL,1
Impacts brain shut off,1
Tf you doing mr impact,1
No way TL makes it out of groups,1
why is such a big diff between machi and psg? or is just TL just really bad,1
I swear Mission is pulling minions out of his ass. He’s just all over the map,1
Controlling a controlled team. Machi paying TL like TL,1
i feel like tsm and tl has had the worst drafts so far...ahhhh,1
My pick ems are dying :(,1
TL will go 0-2 vs machi and end up 4th won't they? Snapping a lot of pickems.,1
TL has 0 engage potential,1
[this hurts my soul](https://puu.sh/GzjY7/b8b48fe03f.png),1
"Jesus, Machi has such huge balls taking that 50/50",1
This game is soooo boring... 8 kills in 30 minutes 🤦‍♂️,1
ok i give up on jensen after that ult,1
Picking Lux instead of Ali/Leo isn't working out. Nothing to walk forward with,1
Jensen is so trash,1
broxah is playing on 100 ping or what?,1
Another na team gifting baron. Secret strategy?,1
"wtf is TL doing, now they will just bleed out and lose the game",1
The classic do nothing and lose. Love to see it,1
Jensen with that iron soloq level vision score.,1
"every year i get my hopes up and every year we fucking suck, think im done with caring about pro league here in NA, embarassing.",1
Giving Broxah graves and then styling on him is big dick energy,1
"watch NA fans flaming broxah if they lose and find excuses for jensen   
(honestly feels bad, I like TL a lot as EU fan, I hope they turn the game)",1
Has Liquid contested a single drake this game?,1
"broxah and jensen are playing evelynn or something, literally invisible.",1
Why did i put TL 3rd ?,1
Well after this game every major region will have a win at worlds!,1
TL showing that NA meta do nothing and lose style,1
"Classic roll over and die strat when behind. At least go for some sort of play, TL have little to lose at this point.",1
"TL looks lost and Idk what jensen is doing, like come on dude",1
"What the fuck, even *I* could get more than 14 vision score in 33 minutes, and I'm the worst LoL player in the world.",1
"I hate TL because they are more passive than a sex doll. If they can't skill gap, they just slowly bleed out.",1
"Its just NA midlaners are so passive, only farming, no proactive plays whatsoever.",1
I was told that this was the group of life for NA....,1
Jensen has been holding his 2 visions wards since the 28th minute. It is as if he bought them so people wont say that he doesnt buy wards,1
Jensen afk,1
"meanwhile every region gets better and better, na always stays the same with this passive do nothing playstyle :(",1
Close to 400 CS!!! Another five or ten minutes and we’re getting that drop haha,1
terrible draft by TL,1
so tl's plan is to bleed every game till jensen gets 4 items?,1
i dont get why NA teams keep this slow gameplay,1
broxah you are going in way too late for the smite steals man,1
Liquid literally can't do anything,1
At least TSM and FQ tried for a few minutes. TL has been dead since they entered the rift.,1
TL really should've picked Leona or something crazy like Blitz. They actually can't ever take a teamfight,1
"I hate to say this but, TL Jatt just got outdrafted",1
The fact neither 5v5 baron has died to a smite is a big testament to the quality of this game lol.,1
"Altough Bruce is missing some skillshots, he is playing great, very safe. Like to see it",1
"Volibear has no QSS, these shouldnt even be 50/50 barons, Impact should be able to flash in and ult him...",1
"shameful display, can we get some competitive gameplay around here",1
Well that happened.. M1ssion was nutty.,1
"Bruce just big dicked with that Ezreal play. 

Yet, TL didn't go for even one fight. Part of it was Machi not letting them and having poor initiation tools, but to go down without even one is just...",1
"Team Lull, do nothing and lose.",1
Good bye group A pickems,1
"apparently play-ins wasn't enough practice for TL, hoping for 1st NA win but boom",1
Mission and Bruce are my BOYS,1
Thats ok impact got his highlight reel LOL,1
"And there goes all of the pickems, nobody had expectations for NA, yet they broke that too",1
TL with the least different picks out of all teams in world lul.,1
Draft diff,1
"TL with the hard throw in draft. No engage, no tanks, no teamfight. How the hell is that team supposed to win the game?",1
NA is officially doomed!,1
NA (0-3) on suicide watch,1
Jensen is done. If he is still on TL after worlds that tells TL ambitions.,1
"Even though i predicted TL to lose yesterday i still had some faith, why am i so stupid? I'm gonna go play some fucking PoE to unwind, fuck this shit ass region.",1
[removed],1
Why did we put our best playmaker on Lux,1
Azael has some of the best head nods while his co caster talks,1
"there is only one way TL wins any game now. CoreJJ on a playmaker, nobody else on the team has playmaking skills",1
"TL is never gonna change, even for the low NA standards they consistently manage to take the do nothing and die style to the absolute maximum every single year",1
Not sure the general feeling on this but NA have always been pretty rough but at least they always have fun banter and rootable players like Dyrus. Like the dignitas days were just fun and I miss them. Now I find all the players super boring :/,1
"TSM looked decent yesterday and even TL looked nice in play ins, shame the game was the way it is.",1
"Too bad for Core and Tactical, but woohoo Machi looking slick",1
Mission just confirmed they knew immediately TL drafted a comp that can't touched them lmfao. Imagine being this bad at drafting.,1
G2 vs Vietnamese jungler oh god help me,1
"
WTF why are they playing Phoenix now? cursing G2 pregame",1
Unless an na team upsets fly vs uol will be our only chance for an upset at this point. It’s so demoralizing to be an na fan. Every worlds our teams look like they don’t improve at all during the break while other teams do.,1
https://twitter.com/endercasts/status/1312681092676227072,1
Well I don't feel as bad for oversleeping now. GG to Machi! First season of a new region and winning their first worlds game? Pretty awesome for them.,1
What's the phoenix - G2 connection?,1
What are these casters talking about? Who are all these ppl surprised? Who didn't have TL as 4th (in groups)?,1
"The TL game was why I was so supportive of FLY yesterday - yes, they got thrashed, but they kept making plays to try to get into the game. TL literally started getting choked out at third drag, and then just laid back and died.",1
"finally SoFM is at worlds, dude is a fucking monster",1
"Glad they're happy, smiling. Now I hope they don't have a jolly run it down together gitty type of game",1
Perkz already smug gg,1
Lets go G2.,1
Caps on a roaming mid? Hell yes,1
"Please g2, please just look good. I don’t need a win early, I just want to see potential and innovation",1
"The draft was not the problem you guys have made it trend that whenever something goes wrong blame the draft this is so wrong as it severally devalues the hard work put by the opposite team. Let me remid you guys that impact use morde only to smurf on mad lions, in the play ins whenever broxah took graves he did great(the only match tl lost was when graves was banned),and in the final knockout of playins the combination of oriana and graves dominated the opposite team and bottom lane was also build by tl such that they would stomp their lane,so the strategy used by tl in this game is similar to the one that they used to get into groups(which was win lane to win game),and as that strategy was working in play ins noone complained about it but as soon as tl face a team which does not allow them to win lane(mind you by using a volibear jungle) then everyone becomes a draft god and passes a judgement that the draft was bad",1
renekton lee lmao these sinners,1
Don't see Caps on TF often.,1
pls not ezreal,1
TF wasn't meta in pro the last few years prior to this right?,1
Jankos carry. We might lose this one.,1
"Ah LPL with the DOTA mindset. CC, skirmish and gank mentality. Hope g2 can match that proactive play",1
the red bull baron buff. thats so fucking cringe,1
"Losing against Top Esports, expected.

Losing to Fnatic? ok.

Losing to Machi? Seriously?",1
"Someone made a good point recently. If LoL wasn't made in NA, only TSM would be at these Worlds right now.",1
"Broxah got his one champion, GG.",1
TL got all their champs lol. GG. How hard is it to ban Graves?,1
"""Now Machi has the red bull baron buff"" ruined the immersion for me",1
Lmao I gave TL a benefit of the doubt and placed them 3rd in my pickems...,1
It's looking great for my picks. I got Machi 3rd and TL 4th :),1
but... but.. tl smurfed in Playins? they must be good right?,1
"I dont think i even witnessed a draft that bad, and i watched a lot of game of Fnatic",1
"Guys I'm scared for the next game, someone hype me up!",1
Imagine the NA teams going 0-18.,1
[removed],1
Rogue > Damwon you heard it here first,1
"So uh, where is the Jensen underrated crowd?",1
"This is probably the worst draft I have seen in the entirety of worlds so far. Literally 0 synergy, no engage, graves pick was awful. Like what can TL do with that draft?",1
3 EU teams gonna play today. Let's go LEC!,1
"Ender and Yamato at the same desk is weird because Ender is a big guy with a tiny head, and Yamato seriously has one of the biggest heads I've ever seen.",1
Seems like Ender lost a bet with Frosk,1
Broxah got graves gg,1
Azael CPTflowers is a great duo. Nice analysis by azael,1
[deleted],1
"Ngl, I feel a bit vindicted, Splyce got constantly downplayed by some NA fans because they ""only"" beat 1st LMS seed to advance last year, but it was never a pushover if you looked at the actual games.",1
[removed],1
"We have one expectation, literally one expectation: it's fine if you lose to the major regions, just don't lose to the minor regions and wildcards. That's all. That's all we expected. We expected so little, yet we got even less. I can't even at this point. Watching your teams do literally nothing the whole game and then just losing is like being slowly suffocated. I don't know how many years I can keep doing this.",1
fly looked better then this,1
We unironically dont deserve a third seed lmao,1
Liquid can't engage. They got outplayed. That's it. No jg difference or outdrafted or that BS. They got outplayed. Better players won the game.,1
"""this year will be different for na, our teams look so good"" - reddit",1
NA without C9 is just a wildcard region at worlds.,1
Nice draft TL. All 3 NA teams should be utterly ashamed of themselves.,1
This TL draft was worse than MAD drafts. Welcome to worlds Jatt,1
Banning Nid and Lillia so that Jankos don't have to play them 😂,1
Not a fan of cpt. Flowers his casting. It's so screamy and load,1
"It's so crazy ornn is allowed to do that much damage

literally like 75% hp adc 2 shot by a fucking tank.",1
"I can't hear Azael's analysis over CaptainFlowers screaming his head off.

I really want to like the guy but his casting is just ""loud"".",1
[removed],1
"Here we go NA fam. Lets goooo. Thank Mr. Broxah, top die",1
Can't wait for TL to let me down.,1
Ender is a kpop boy. K/DA replacement member confirmed,1
"That's a cool chair, if i had a couple of thousands of dollars to waste i would get one for sure.",1
Ender reading this thread Sadge,1
Hmm so today there is 3 interesting match and 3 one sided stomp. Well maybe RGE vs DWG will be closer than what is expected at least I hope so.,1
can't wait for TSM to let me down again,1
"I heard Kindred was used in at least 3 Worlds matches so far, anyone know which team uses them? Or any specific game they were used in?",1
"Even tho I'm from EU i feel like 0-3 day for LEC, G2 will ramp up later on and Fnatic week 2 buff",1
"Please don't fuck up, TL

Edit: They fucked it up.",1
"Should be interesting to see group A. Although G2 seems like favourites, there's a good chance they hard int games. The actual form these teams have will be so revealing for who actual stands a good chance at getting out.",1
earring,1
"Love the earring...but it’s very distracting,",1
Captain flowers looks like Taric. Wtf?!?,1
Jensen looks like he needs a booster seat.,1
"why does one of the casters sound like hes on 1.5 speed

so high pitched and fast lol, not azale the other one.

edit: it's fixed now, no idea wtf that was.",1
"no ban or fp graves, im already mad",1
Tactical got 2 cups its gg ez.,1
Maybe i was right about Steve paying off teams to make banning Graves illegal.,1
TL getting so much comfort holy,1
"Syndra vs Ori, god reminds me of when I picked ori into syndra thinking her shield would protect me from syndra's ult...it did not. I was brutalised.",1
"In before Jhin/Leona for TL

edit: i was completely wrong LOL",1
"Ngl, Ashe looks badass with that new face feature",1
If TL loses after this draft there's no hope,1
Luigi death stare,1
"OH shit I take it back, tac 3 cups confirmed. TL worlds win up coming.",1
"No engage, no cc from liquid with a mordekaiser graves combo. Hope they can out scale and wait for Machi to engage",1
I love that Tactical isn't scared of picking Cait. Hope he delievers,1
Do you think Broxah subscribed to r/GravesMains?,1
Where are Machi from,1
"Machi comp seems to lack something. There are a lot of engage and  disengage tools, but I fear they don't have enough punch.",1
TLs draft scares me a little. The lack of engage and small front line is worrysum into 2 big tanks and good late game damage. Hope we can keep out pacing them,1
"aaaand THAT'S why they picked lux, god damn",1
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,1
"ofc Jensen playing a bit too confident  


love jj aggression tho",1
easiest flash jensen....,1
"Welcome to Worlds, Machi X!",1
Jensen on worlds form already,1
"He's let syndra kill him, RIP.",1
obviously im rooting for NA but i really wanna see the LMS finally having more success,1
legit sad watching na,1
"New to the league world, where is MCX from ?",1
"Jesus TL, come on, wake up",1
"Interesting that Broxah is playing a farming jungler but Gemini is having much more impact to allow for a potential snowball.

Why are farming junglers more favourable in this current meta if snowball heavy matches are still so prevalent?",1
"lmao this Ornn is so disrespectful, building items directly in front of Morde",1
"This early game was actually pretty grief from Broxah. He didn't do the basic early ward in top side pixel brush and then swap to Sweeper. I don't remember the time at which Gemini ganked, but if he warded at 52 seconds, the latest to back before 1 minute, the ward would still spot him if he ganked before 2:22.",1
"Wait a second, TL got Graves and the Cait&Lux combo. What did Machi ban ?",1
"that was good, he was going to flash anyway. He waited until the right moment stun was about to proc and got voli flash for it",1
Only botlane saving TL,1
Machi was the biggest question mark for me in this tournament. Really impressed by their mid/jg duo so far.,1
"Completely different from the perfect game vs VCS from rogue

This is even",1
Misson looks good honestly,1
"After all those plates, Gold Diff's still not on a thousand?",1
Jensen getting schooled again,1
cant wait to clap mission :D,1
"Ironic seeing TSM fan boiz in here commenting on Jensen but their team got absolutely bodied last night. TL showed they can do well regardless of the outcome of this game...TSM shat the bed on their comfort pics aswel. Strong lol, lol is strong.",1
Didn't expect Broxah to be outclassed here,1
I YOLOed them 2nd in my pick ems. hope it pay offs,1
1 more lvl and Ornn is broken,1
"Looks like this game might come down to team fights with Tactical popping off, weird it’s only 2/2 kills arm",1
"Who ever gets hit by Syndras outplaybutton, hf.",1
"mfw

https://youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=P3GXvvPEiks&t=25",1
"Gold is very close, but it feels like machi has the control. Still one big play could swing a match both ways.",1
Syndra is literally getting funneled and people wonder why he's so ahead in gold xd,1
So I’m guessing the gap between Machi and the regular PSG Talon lineup is represented well by their 3-0?,1
the onus is on Machi though Caitlyn is going to get giga oppressive,1
Wow. We're gonna lose this game aren't we?,1
Game is far more closer than I would have thought.,1
Team liquid  just AFK and let Ornn voli to tank up and your just going to die with these squishy champs    playing auto pilot league of legends even at worlds,1
cmon TL. I have you on 3rd on my pick ems,1
TL's coaching staff of the split cannot draft engage for their teamfighting comp btw,1
oh man NA are going to do the 0-18 aren't they,1
"Remember when Jensen was the shining light on his team at worlds?

What happened?",1
well Mission is taking his junglers camp and jensen is sacrificing farm to broxah and tactical. There is mid diff but not as bad as it looks,1
Holy shit tactical lived but that flash was so fucking confident this guy mission is so fun to watch!,1
That could have been a very dead Caytlin,1
"Both bot lanes have had very little impact all game.

I genuinely feel bad for bot lane players.",1
"TL lost this, horrible overall and no scaling when compared to Machi",1
"Ornn the fucking assassin, get this champ out of the game",1
TL WILL COMEBACK DO NOT LOSE HOPE,1
How did Koala die?,1
Jensen continuing his worlds performance from last year (except for that one great game),1
"""oof"" is all I can say",1
TL back in LCS form,1
Group A is actually group C in disguise.,1
tactical has been grossly out of position 2 times now,1
"Thank god Broxah went to NA and, inarguably, was worse off for it.",1
TL doomed the self by letting ornn go through. Said it earlier outdrafted super hard,1
Don't forget being down 50cs and getting mid gapped by a wildcard midlaner,1
It's pretty doomed,1
With what we have seen so far from all 3 NA representatives that statement isn't wrong.,1
Thank you! I was just saying that,1
How is that even possible in proplay???,1
The jingle that plays every time the gold graph appears annoys me more than it should!,1
Full chandeliers hanging from his ears.,1
Imagine being the guy who drunkenly put TL in second place...,1
Hey hey... TSM will lose later today don't stop at 0-3.,1
"Na were always late to global metas, they're just trying out the week 1 EU strat. Trust",1
Oh no doubt,1
Is it lucky though? Looks like more games of torture for NA to me. -\_-,1
but but i must repeat Ls opinions,1
These 1am games most def are killing me. I'm glad they played that song. We all know Take Over sucks haha,1
"Lmfaoooo

This is my fav  https://youtu.be/bbfy05y5Ukw",1
Actually insufferable.,1
wait did he retire??,1
"Cant wait to see Finn dominating over nuguri, the 5head sandbag strat during the entire LEC summer split",1
he's honestly just a beautiful man,1
nah the silver supp would build all ap and steal all the waves lol,1
"Well, PSG with the smurfing duo looked really good, but yesterday's PSG ...",1
Nah we’ve been dead for years. We just here for the ride,1
My sleep schedule is already fucked but yeah theres a lot of things I could be doing instead of suffering through this,1
Fly is better than TL,1
"i mean for play ins i did day 1 three times.....

LOOK I MAKE THESE RIGHT BEFORE I SLEEP",1
Wouldn't have it any other way.,1
"NA verbal advertising in-game, won't ever be a fan of that culture.",1
You cannot compare flowers hair to phreaks hobo beard...,1
yes gl vs caps,1
Gotta make up for Jensen,1
No they are just playing against teams they can't bully with experience.,1
"I put Machi 3rd tbh, TL was overrated af",1
flyquest seemed p good at teamfighting despite being down a metric fuckton,1
Gotta attempt to stay relevant,1
"was obvious c9 was gonna jerk themselves over NA, too bad it makes no sense since they couldnt even beat any of these 3 lmao",1
"Same thing as UoL, fucking tilting. The game is completely based around Jungle and TL has a weak jungler.",1
">Everyone comes to LA 

NA needs to move their LCS HQ closer to the server (Chicago), would give the pros better ping. And this would also stop them from vacationing in the most beautiful city in America (subjective).",1
id rather have a MAD lions incident then see the same players fail every year. bc you know they are gonna take that embarrassment and use it as fuel and come back stronger. its a culture problem for sure.,1
Good morning :),1
give me a jankos lee sin,1
They usually play it Live on the Finals opening ceremony.,1
NAmen,1
 ヽʕ •ᴥ•ʔﾉ Raise your koalas ヽʕ •ᴥ•ʔﾉ,1
Karen ganked for Sandra and Jensen didn't respect the power of middle management,1
Gotta make up for Jensen,1
Worlds song the year g2 lost finals,1
"Maybe TL wouldn't be there, but results wise NA is way better than PCS or VN who have two teams.",1
"Stop, I can only get so hard",1
[removed],1
Ima eat my dick if this happens,1
"Loud*

But I get it, me neither.",1
> Does NA deserve ~~3~~ spots at worlds?,1
Can't be let down by TL when you expect nothing.,1
There's still time for him to learn choreography to do that weird light dance thing for the closing ceremonies.,1
he looks like the snitch in your class that burns toy soldiers with a magnifier in his free time,1
"I hate syndras ult so much lol, even killing her doesn't cancel the stupid thing.",1
PCS which is the former LMS which is taiwan,1
They're from the PCS - Taiwan,1
Taiwan,1
Pcs (old LMS),1
Taiwanese team that plays in the PCS,1
"PCS, former SEA league + LMS as they combined iirc",1
edit: tf/twitch/shen and rakan/thresh,1
Mission has a nasty farm lead.,1
tl bot lane has like a 2k gold lead but syndra alone has a 1.5k lead on ori,1
DELICIOUS LIQUID TEARS ARE DELICIOUS,1
"Getting funneled? He farms the enemy jungle camps and his waves all alone, there is legit no funnel from his team. Secondly no one is wondering why she has the most gold. You write alot of .... in this thread sir.",1
Bushfire :(,1
"> getting mid gapped by a wildcard midlaner

Eh it’s acceptable for one wildcard midlaner to gap another",1
I am the only one who likes it apparently 😂 I kinda think it slaps.,1
Not yet.,1
Back to Lissandra it is,1
I expect nothing of all the NA teams and I'm still let down.,1
Thanks !,1

"If Inside the NBA covered the recent news...

Ernie: “Breaking news, Donald Trump has tested positive for the coronavirus. Guys, let’s get your thoughts, Chuck, we’ll start with you.”

Chuck: “Erneh... Donald Trump is a big ol dummy. He didn’t take the virus seriously, and now he has it, and he didn’t do anything to defend it. Speakin of defense, Erneh... Miami’s interior defense in game 1 really hurt them badly, and I hope Bam Adabayou and Goran Dragik are okay. Here’s the thing, Erneh... Trump now has Covid, and this is gonna be turrible for him. We’ll have to see, Erneh... but by the looks of it, he likes food more than even Shaq over here!”

Erneh: “Shaq, your thoughts.”

Shaq: “Well, here’s the thing, Erneh. Trump has the virus, he caught it, he got contaminated, he extracted it from the air, he has officially entered this virus infection phase. The fact is, this virus has been dominating the glass for the past few months, and it’s feasting on barbecue chicken all over the country. Now, I know a thing or two about feasting, and so do my Lakers and my man, Anthony Davis. But I’m a doctor, and I know what it takes to get things done. My Miami Heat gotta answer back in game 2, and I think Trump’s gotta answer back after this diagnosis.”

Jet: “Well, okay... hold on, doc... you’re not even that kind of doctor. Okay, let’s take it to the board. (Runs) Remember this game? 1997, Michael Jordan in the finals... they called this the flu game. Jordan had his best game when he got sick, but I gotta say, Trump ain’t no Jordan. The big fella, see this Covid chart, he’s right here... he just got infected. And that puts these numbers over here. But then, take a look at this... look at these numbers Hakeem the Dream put up back in 95 when we won the finals. Now those are some numbers! But I gotta say, Trump’s got his work cut out for him.”

Chuck: “Yeah, and Shaq’s got his 4th piece of pizza cut out for him right about now, too!”

Shaq: “Don’t you bad mouth my Papa John’s, Chuck!”

This was a wild way to learn Shaq has a doctorate in education.,0
No and I want to as well. It should be interesting,0
I’d say it’s worth it if you loved those bulls or lakers teams and want to know more. He has some good insights and stories on those teams.,0
"I didn't read Eleven Rings but I tried to read his Sacred Hoops. It was too spiritual for me but I should have expected that knowing what people say about him. And from reading the tittle...
Is Eleven Rings similarly philosophical and spiritual?
Fun fact: Sacred Hoops audiobook is read by Phil Jackson himself. Almost makes me want to try again.",0
"As a lakers fan, what Phil had to say about the 2010 finals against Boston was super rewarding to read.",0
I really enjoyed it. If you’re a Mike/Kobe fan you’ll really like it.,0
Become a Lakers fan then,0
"5 on the floor is pretty good. Insider info and they go into X’s and O’s. They’re a Heat podcast though. They upload every weekday. Locked On NBA is usually pretty good too. Only read the episode description today and it doesn’t seem like they talk much about the game today though. There doesn’t seem to be a ton of coverage on these finals though, it’s kinda weird",0
"I've been a little disappointed by the podcast analysis as well. I feel like I'm missing something. Might just be that Dunc'd On went paid?

Also Simmons has become unlistenable, so that takes away a lot.

EDIT TO ADD:

The Cousin Sal network ones (Extra Points, The People's Sports Podcast) are decent. They care more about football but they're better casual talk than Simmons. 

True Hoop's Bring It In is great. For some reason Abbott isn't on the Game 1 one, but the guy breaking stuff down is excellent. Real analysis.",0
I hope Miami takes at least one game. Getting swept in the Finals might be worse than not making it.,0
You realize 2/3 heats best players are out right? RIP,0
Kevin Harlan: “DONALD TRUMP WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE!”,0
lol you must have forgot the first half of the season,0
Short term memory r/nba,0
Waiters gets a ring no matter who wins haha.,0
"As i always say. Im a lebron fan first, raptors fan second",0
I know people who don’t live in a city with a NBA team and don’t feel any type of support for the closest one to them. I can understand when those people decide to admire a player and follow his career. For those that live in a city with a team I don’t judge them but I always wonder why they don’t like that team,0
Its funny...when he played with Lebron.. we raved about him. He was perfect as Robin. Then he left to become Batman and went splat. Tale of two careers thus far,0
Asking the real questions lol,0
Wipe his nose,0
I know I am not. Its so obvious the Lakers will win its not fun to watch.,0
Are we already in the off-season,0
Laughed for 4 min straight,0
"It’s not an upgrade. Sometimes ya just gotta make moves, and grab what’s available.",0
"Hey man, this is a pretty late reply and I'm sorry for that, but the games are on ESPN.",0
Because he keeps saying dumber and dumber things.,0
Drop a gem on ‘em.,0
"I hated Lebron his whole career. It was a big pill to swallow when he joined lakers. Sure enough i started to like him, then as he’s on your team you see more of how he carries himself in his personal life. 

Damn it, he’s too good of a player, and human. 

Rondo earned his laker jersey the day he punched CP3.",0
Its true...that much dominance and attention breeds contempt. Lebron cant help it that he is the only guy we really want to talk about,0
Id vote lebron as president np,0
"Considering KAT and D'Angelo Russell are supposedly good friends, I can’t see why the Timberwolves would bring in a new PG.",0
Lol. Ur gonna be suprised,0
"They’ll be very good next year. They won’t be overpowering. They‘ll be a contender, but definitely won’t dominate",0
Probably because Lakers are still playing and the Celtics aren’t?,0
All fans are insufferable when their team is good. I’ve never heard someone complain about a Charlotte fan.,0
"Look at twitter, google/youtube analytics. Its never been more popular...its just that younger folks dont watch cable tv anymore",0
No it's not,0
"You're talking about TV ratings, aren't you? Funny how before the pandemic and BLM protests, whenever the falling NBA TV ratings are mentioned, the main consensus is how the concept of Cable Television is slowly becoming outdated. More and more people, especially the younger ones, are watching the NBA through ""unconventional means"" with the help of the internet. But now, somehow the reason is *""oh no the NBA is getting political. Go woke, go broke amirite""*.

On another thread about this, people also talked about how the current NHL viewing stocks has fallen by a lot compared to last year. Also it's apparently a no-brainer (I'm not American so I'm not familiar bout this), another possible reason for the NBA/NHL low view count is because this part of the year is NFL/MLB season so more people are tuning into that. 

That being said, it's really multiple factors. The pandemic, overall lack of crowds in games (leading to less enthusiasm for the home audience), lack of focus on sports in this today's news cycle (especially with the US elections coming up), it's not basketball season this time of the year etc etc. And yeah, there's probably a small percentage of old white boomers who got turned off due to the players exercising their rights to speak out. Sucks for them, did they expect anything else?


>What can be done?

I dunno about you guys, but there's anything that annoys me with the NBA right now is the reffing. It's frustrating how 20 seconds left in the fourth quarter is equivalent to 8 minutes (or more) in real time. This shit happened for a lot in the recent playoff games (multiple times in the Celtics-Raptors series and a couple of times in the Celtics-Heat one). Don't forget the stupid ass ejections in the Mavs-Clips series. Fans want to watch the players play, not for the refs to hog the spotlight.",0
"Bro don’t put lakers and trump in the same sentence. 

This is a safe space for glorious copy
Pasta, not politics.",0
"As someone who follows 538 pretty closely, their reaction today was wild. They had a chat discussion between the analysts about how Trump's COVID would affect the election,which is something they do pretty frequently for big events. Every single one said they had no clue how this would affect the race. This is the first time I have *ever* seen them unanimously agree that they have no idea whatsoever how something is going to affect the election.",0
"He tweeted it right before Trump did lmao, what a legend",0
If you're looking for Xs and Os analysis the Laker Film Room and Lakers Exceptionalism podcast are both heavy on analytics. They're obviously Lakers fans but they give the numbers and such straight up.,0
Is Simmons voice getting higher with age? Hard to listen to,0
Please let us get a game or two!,0
they still have UDONIS for game 3,0
Would’ve been better if NBA Bubble,0
"> He was perfect as Robin

and now is Nightwing",0
He got exposed afterwards and there was no one to tell him to be quiet.,0
I appreciate it man. Here's to hoping for a game 5 then haha,0
What do you mean?,0
"They are what you're describing right now. Without the offseason.

Don't underestimate them.",0
"True, that hasn't happened in about a decade.",0
You aren’t American so you wouldn’t understand,0
"Not politics? Sports and politics are not mutually exclusive. If that were the case, we wouldn't be seeing threads about voting and the fight for social justice. It's good to have uncomfortable conversations regardless of which side someone is on.",0
Did he? I thought he just tweeted it withing a minute after,0
Laker film room is fantastic,0
His ears are definitely getting lower. No way that dude could wear glasses.,0
Yeah no shit,0
We’ve been spoiled for a while ... we needed that decade off lol,0
That’s true. But you didn’t need to wake up the Celtics fans in their own sub to write that.,0

"I know the total rebound numbers don't look insane from the box score, but the Lakers just destroyed the Heat around the basket. Their combination of size and athleticism just swarms the paint on offense and defense.

Also I acknowledge that Olynyk was good, but watching the game, it's clear that he was overmatched. A complete sieve on defense, atrocious. And he shot well but took some AWFUL shots that really killed any flow the Heat had at points.",0
"The Lakers showed more in one game vs zone than the Celtics did in entire series IMO. 

But this zone was a bit modified as well. They always kept two players on AD while in a zone (yes it sounds weird, but I don't know how to describe that with other words, bottom left/right players were marking AD). When he did manage to get a ball to the post he would either turn around and shoot or pass to three point line where players were usually open.

But even when AD didn't receive the ball, his presence at high post alone resulted in so much gravity among other Heat players. That meant wide open shooters for Lakers. 

And then there were other really cool variations by Lakers. AD was put on low post, LeBron/Rondo/Caruso went at high post and often times they put up easy mid range floater/jumper, or moved the ball with ease. 

Lakers having 47 3-point attempts means they played vs the zone properly. They attacked it through middle, through above the break three pointers and sometimes through low post when the center low men went to high post attacker. It really looked perfect IMO.

But I don't really know what else the Heat can do. When they played AD 1v1 he just torched them. LeBron would have abused man defense even more with constant matchup chasing...

Olynyk was really good on offense and hit couple of shots, Butler was really good in playmaking role, and Heat adapted to playing without Bam by spacing a lot more (IMO). But Bam was missing on the rebounding aspect. AD got 8 OFFENSIVE REBOUNDS. And most of them ended up in points.",0
"Lakers should've won by 20+. The Heat sort of hung around the entire 2nd half when there were many chances to put them away and the Lakers as a team did not feel as focused and disciplined as they did in G1. Of course a lot of it is moot when AD is otherworldly unguardable.

Miami needs to have Bam on the floor whenever AD is playing to have any hope of competing. I don't know what combination of bigs they have to not get dominated on the boards. Maybe we see more Bam/Olynyk? Bam/Leonard?

I thought the Lakers played into Miami's defensive gameplan by taking 47 3's. A lot of them were wide open practice-type shots. Maybe it's unsustainable to expect Green/KCP to go 3/19 from such open 3's again, but with the streakiness of their shooters, you never know. I think Miami tries something similar in G3 with the hopes that Bam is able to clean up more of the boards. Even if a 70% Bam played in this game, we'd see a much closer result.",0
Heat kept it very close despite not having Bam/Dragic,0
"Butler said it himself, Heat basically need to be *perfect* to stay in it against LAL. And to their credit, they did have some strong stretches and they did keep LAL honest throughout. 

But Lakers just have that proverbial extra gear, they have adjustments and versatility the Heat can't really match. 

Game 1, the Lakers had a huge free throw advantage and that was one of the points that you figured wouldn't be the case every game. Sure enough, Game 2, Heat have a huge free throw advantage, but it didn't really make the difference. 

Lakers rebounding is stifling, and more than made up for all their missed threes. 

As with game 1, and really this entire postseason for LAL, I trust the Lakers ability to continue to make adjustments and refine their operation more than I trust their opponent to do the same. Heat seemed to be more scrambled to find anything that might work and any time they seemed to find something, it wasn't long before the Lakers started to dismantle that, too. I mean, once you have Lebron getting wide open layups against a zone defense, you know you're hosed, pretty much.",0
"AD is great at playing D without fouling but I think the heat need to go at him early and force the issue with the refs. More often then not he’ll make you look stupid, but if AD gets into foul trouble, it’s worth it. Heat started the game going at him but didn’t keep it up. 

This shows you how dominant the Lakers are. Heat have to hope for foul trouble to make it a series. 

Butlers shot was not falling early but he had a hell of a game. Probably one of his best these playoffs.",0
"1.	AD’s sequence where he couldn’t miss was fucking amazing to watch. 

2.	It’s obvious how serious Lebron and AD take this series. It’s literally brought out the best of AD and Lebron knows how much of a threat the heat are. They know that a 10 point comeback is possible and if they don’t come prepared the heat could easily come back. 

3.	Lebron and AD both played for 39 minutes they weren’t taking any chances. They know that if they show anything besides 100% effort while on the floor we would exploit it. Also I know they want the sweep. If you give a team like the heat even one victory it could change or swing momentum. 

Honestly this is an amazing series to watch imo. AD and Lebron are forced to play perfectly every time and watching them do that is amazing to watch. 

Also no matter the results of this series I’m really proud of the heat even with two starters injured we went out there and pushed them to their limits. Every victory is going to be hard earned in this series.",0
This might be the closest the heat get to winning a game. I dont see the FT difference occurring again and I think Danny and KCP might hit a shot next game. Hopefully bam plays because the lakers wrecked them on the offensive board,0
"I'm torn between recognizing Lebron's greatness and being happy for AD, and just being bored of watching Lebron and one other superstar wipe the floor with everyone.

We tried to convince ourselves the league was competitive this year, but it will never be as long as Lebron gets the roster he wants. It's not a knock on him, and I'm sure the fans of him and the franchises he's brought success to don't feel that way; he's just great. The only way to stop him when things go his way is to create a superteam.",0
"Yeah Olynyk was really trying to be a hero out there to win the game and he's just not the guy for that.

In the words of Bane: ""Admirable, but mistaken"".",0
like when he took a running deep 3 off the dribble for no reason? i was dumbfounded. ruined all their momentum,0
"Lakers shot 33/50 from 2 point range, that’s insane. It was 17/20 at the half.",0
"I guess they were just tired because I see them hustling all over the court to cover the perimeter players, but then when the Lakers put up a shot, the Heat all stop and don't box out the 1 Laker under the rim.",0
Yeah this is over. The Heat are just physically overmatched. And Rondo especially was great flashing to the center of the zone. He and Bron are such great passers that it was just completely ineffective. Plus AD had so many dump off dunks. The Heat had a shit ton of free throws and couldn't even get within 10.,0
Dude Rondo watches so much tape he probably saw every Heat game and cracked the code before the series even started. He's the one who breaks down strategy for the rest of the players. The Lakers have no problem finishing out this series with Miami mostly in a zone. Especially with Bam and Dragic out. Huge losses.,0
"I mean the Heat are missing by far their best defender and the Lakers have better size to take advantage of the zone. Boston was doing pretty well against the zone for the last 2 games, but it was too late.",0
Only because KO went off in the 3rd and DG/KCP/Kuzma forgot how to shoot,0
"Heat's offense seemed to be about as good as it could be under the circumstances. 

The defense and particularly rebounding lost it for them. Really felt the absence of Bam on the offensive boards.",0
"KO is a good substitute for Bam and went off. If Bam was in, Bam would just have the points that KO have and we would still have a similar score.",0
"Honestly I feel like the Lakers currently are one of the most versatile teams we have seen, being able to switch from full small ball match up vs HOU, to four players 6'8 and above vs DEN, have many people who can guard perimeter and paint, and their shooting is not super bad, it's just sporadic for some reason.",0
Mans gonna have 9 blocks. But okay they should try,0
Never thought I'd see the day when someone says they should go at AD on defense lol. This sounds like Nuggets fans saying they should just let Lebron shoot wide open 3s all game. Good luck I guess.,0
"I think you're being a bit hyperbolic on how hard AD and Lebron are being ""forced"" to play by the Heat lol. As someone who's watched the Lakers all season and knows when they've entered their own version of ""Flying Death Machine Mode"", the Lakers and especially LeBron were honestly playing at like 85% effort max. Not to be a jerk and burst your bubble or anything, but you're feelin yourself a liiiiittle too much there chief. You're not gonna see 100% or perfect LeBron until it's time to close out the series. 

You guys are playing great and tough and all that stuff but let's not act like you're forcing LeBron and AD to bunker down and use their Ace in the hole on you. The Lakers are playing focused, not desperate. If they were playing desperate last night it would've been like a 20-25 point blowout if we're being completely honest. You're for sure making them earn this sweep, but at no point has this series felt ""competitive"" where both teams were trying their hardest.",0
"It was competitive. Is it the Lakers fault that Curry/Klay and KD/Kyrie were injured? Not our fault that Kawhi/PG13 were hyped up to win the championship by a lot of people then historically collapsed. Same with Westbrook/Harden. It's revisionist history to claim that LeBron/AD are suddenly this superteam that everyone knew was gonna win the championship this year when a lot of people were calling the Lakers the meme team for having Rondo, Dwight, JR, Caruso, and Kuzma. This year was the year of every contending team having 2 superstars and no more 3 superstar KD Warriors. There was actual parity again. It just so happened that the East was injured and couldn't do anything better than the Bucks and Celtics who underachieved and the Heat who seriously overachieved. Now it looks completely lopsided because all of the Lakers challengers with uninjured stars were in the West.",0
"If you think this Lakers team is unbeatable you’re on drugs.

Massive roster flaws in this Laker team, carried by two superstars yes but this is not a super team.

Going to be a wide open League next year",0
What happened to the rest of the roster sucked narrative?,0
Teams look out for themselves and so should Lebron and other players.,0
"It doesn’t take a superteam to beat Lebron. That’s not even close to true. Lebron’s Heat teams were tested every year and lost a couple. Warriors-Cavs was an extremely competitive matchup before KD joined. This year’s Laker team has very real flaws. If you feel resigned that Lebron’s team is just gonna win it every year, then I’m sorry you just haven’t been watching enough basketball.",0
They'll be a super team if they can get Bradley Beal. This sub would lose their shit. lol,0
"Idk, I’m watching these playoffs and thinking that a healthy golden state, steph, klay, Wiggins, Dray, wiseman (#2 pick) plus all those dudes that got good run this year coming off the bench, will run the through the league like a roach coach chicken burrito left out over night.",0
[deleted],0
"I think there was a point where Olynyk took a very deep 3 while Miami was chipping at the lead and I got legitimately mad at him. It wasn't even close to going in and it was completely unnecessary. Id be okay with Duncan doing it, he makes those frequently, but absolutely not Olynyk.",0
"Things can change in a series, but if Bam's back next game, I don't see how Robinson has a long look if he doesn't hit shots early.",0
I wouldn’t say he was trying to be a hero. I think he just recognized that someone needed to generate offense and stepped up. I appreciate the willingness to be assertive...I wish Butler had brought the same aggressive mentality.,0
"That was a real head-scratcher, for sure.",0
[Here's Rondo and KCP casually watching the Heat game at dinner with the rest of the team](https://imgur.com/a/F9WV5Jy). I don't recall the heat going zone against Bucks tho,0
I felt like Brown should have the ball more; he's really good at picking his spots and driving at the right time,0
"DG, KCP, and Kuzma with inconsistent shooting has been a theme for the Lakers all year:/
 
Hope Bam and Goran get better soon",0
"technically Lakers are terrible from the 3 point line, Duncan forgot to shoot the last 5 games.",0
KCP had a poor night but DG and Kuzma been ass this whole playoffs.,0
At the end of the third they were shooting 50/40/90 as a team which is pretty insane.,0
Bam >> KO on defense and especially the boards.,0
"KO played hard but he did hella stupid shit tonight, he killed our offense so many times with horrendous shots. I was not a fan. He did alright on D but goddamn do we need bam back",0
"It may not be effective, but AD is their defensive lynchpin so it’s worth a shot. Getting him in foul trouble gives the Heat a chance. Similar to the strategy the Lakers used in Game 1 against Bam, who is a also great defender.",0
"You're right. The only gripe some people have is that while AD is nearly a 1st tier superstar, and joined LeBron ""because"".

He is _definitely_ better than all other 2nd options on other teams, just not capable enough to carry a team as the 1st option.

If he hadn't hit those miracle 3-pointers in game 2 against Denver, the series would have been tougher. Yet, that series was the hardest for LAL, and they never really seemed comfortable.

Next year LeBron will be 1 year older, probably 1/10 of a step slower, while the Warriors/Nets will be back, Denver will be better and other teams will also arise.",0
Every team has flaws. It just seems like everyone focuses on just the Lakers ones.,0
"People acting like we're the KD Warriors when we are not even close to them.

We only got two all stars on our team.",0
"I didn't say this is a superteam. I said that it would take a superteam to beat them, which isn't the same thing as unbeatable. He's got another star so he doesn't have to do everything by himself and role players that play their role well, for the most part. That's what I meant by him getting what he wants. It's been his formula for a decade, and it's still working.",0
"Lakers will also get better. One better shooter, Avery Bradley back... It'll be interesting.",0
"The supporting cast is way bigger, better, and deeper than you think my guy. The Lakers are gonna stomp the league next season if they're healthy lol. They've won EVERY game that they shot even 30% from 3 or more. They're too dominant around the margins lol. A lot of things need to go your way just to get 1 win against them, and they'll have a training camp and off-season to gel now.",0
They shifted to Plan Q,0
"I agree, the players are the main reason the league exists, so they should do what makes them happy, even if it makes things more predictable. I know I'm in the minority because GS vs CLE was great for ratings, and people have always liked watching those who dominate, like Kobe and Shaq, MJ, Bill Russell, etc.",0
How would you know if it’s fun to watch if you haven’t tuned in?,0
That was a 30+ footer. Idk what the point of that was,0
He missed some key freethrows as well.,0
Is there a video of this?,0
"That's fair. I think they definitely need to work on getting him involved more since he's pretty clearly their 2nd best player. I think his lack of use is a result of his off ball style. Brown isnt a great pick and roll player, due to his only so so handle. He generally gets the ball once he already has some sort of advantage on his man. 

I think Stevens needs to do a better job of creating some easy actions they can go to for Brown, that don't involve him as the pick and roll ball handler. I do expect him to become a better pick and roll player, but i'm not sure that's ever gonna be a super efficient play",0
"KCP does not belong on that list, its become an anomaly this season when he shoots poorly.",0
"KCP has been consistent 41% this postseason, only Blazers game 2 did he have a terrible shooting night.",0
"He didn't forget, he's been locked up. He still generates decent offense with his patented little jump passes to the man on the short roll.",0
They're dogs,0
"> Next year LeBron will be 1 year older, probably 1/10 of a step slower, while the Warriors/Nets will be back, Denver will be better and other teams will also arise.

Honest question, do you believe LeBron will be less effective with an extra year of age than KD will be coming off an achilles tear? If people predict LeBron's decline every offseason, it will eventually happen because that's how father time works. But I think it's premature to make that prediction until we see evidence.",0
Agree. Lakers are a couple of good free agents away to be even more stacked next season,0
[deleted],0
yea there is. I took the screenshot from Backstage Lakers episode which is available on the Sportsnet Lakers website.,0
"I think part of it is the offense - there were too many plays where he was just standing and waiting for Tatum/Smart/Kemba to do something. He'd be good as a high-ball screener, knowing when to pick or pop. Next season should be great for him with some extra responsibilities on offense.",0
But only consistent from the far left corner catch and shoot. Yet he is paid less than Green which is a mystery to me who is inconsistent all the time worse than Duncan.,0
"> Honest question, do you believe LeBron will be less effective with an extra year of age than KD will be coming off an achilles tear?

Not at all. LeBron will still be a beast. Lebron with a slight reduction in athleticism (_slight_) still is _huge_. We can't _really_ know about KD, but well, he is KD. 

My statement didn't imply that those teams will steamroll over the Lakers. Just that there will be competition. As _there was_ this year - people also conveniently forget that Denver played in these playoffs without one of tjeir starters - Barton _is_ extremely important for the team, offensively and defensively, and was the main factor for the Nuggets during a large stretch of this season.",0
They don't have the cap space for those until after next year though,0
"And like no ability to get those FAs. And no assets to make trades. And despite the evidence thus far, Lebron will age. This team is fun and we should enjoy it, it ain't going to last forever.",0
"You should try, this series has been very cool from a gameplanning perspective. The Heat offense is so so good - even when they are missing Bam and Dragic. Lot of it comes down to player movement around their big man setting a screen. 

The Lakers have made a lot of tweaks on how to defend their screen and roll game. First game, they made a big effort to focus on Bam by giving him space at the right places (since he doesn't like to pull-up or shoot long enough jumpers); he had 0 assists and like 1 potential assist, which is a lot different than how he's had it the rest of the playoffs. They play ball denial on Duncan Robinson b/c of his lightning quick release thru hand-offs and they sprint at Herro to run him off the 3pt line b/c he's less effective pulling up off a dribble. 

It's a lot of little things and coaching has been great both sides. Heat are in it b/c of that, even with their injuries. Lakers were very effective in the paint yesterday but it was due to the zone that they forced almost 50 Laker 3 pointers.",0
"Thanks, is it from the latest episode?",0
">As there was this year - people also conveniently forget that Denver played in these playoffs without one of tjeir starters - Barton is extremely important for the team, offensively and defensively, and was the main factor for the Nuggets during a large stretch of this season.

Yeah, the Lakers have been playing without a starter in Avery Bradley as well. He had some big games against good teams this season (Clippers, Spurs, Rockets, Memphis, etc.). Not that AB is make or break for the Lakers, but he definitely would've been a plus to have at the point of attack/full court defensive pickups.",0

">	A failed state is a political body that has disintegrated to a point where basic conditions and responsibilities of a sovereign government no longer function properly.

I think the fact that 12 million people are without jobs and tens of millions are financially struggling hardcore while the government has done almost nothing to help during a pandemic that has killed 200k people is the reason why people are thinking the US is a failed state.

The US has a plethora of issues rn (and normally) but they’re far from a failed state. I urge you to reconsider that statement. And I fucking hate it here lol,0
"says fat kid in his moms basement snacking on doritos safe af from any discomfort, never mind actual danger

I think the people that suggest the US is a failed state are idiots and don’t know what they’re talking about. Simpler answer.,0
Much of europe is in a worse shape. Are they failed states too,0

Both of those are local or state issues though.,0

They'll all fly back to confirm Amy Coney Barrett at the drop of a hat. It's very important that we make sure that everybody having their lives torn apart by a global pandemic now are all saddled with a pre-existing condition. Calls on ANTM (up 2 percent already).,0
no really since they got 3 rep senators with rona now...,0
"> If there is a bill on the table they can be called back early as well.

By McConnell.

So if there isn't something he wants done during their recess, they aren't going to get called back.

Vote on bill to help working class people?  Vacation time.

Vote to confirm a Christian fundamentalist supreme court judge?  We're bending any rule necessary to make it happen.",0

"Nobody in the government does shit in person. They send their assistants or aides or whatever. Only time politicians meet in person is if the person they’re going to meet is going to line their pocket aka lobbyists, VPs, and CEOs",0

That’s just gas on a fire,0
Imo it just shows that the Supreme Court was designed in a naive way. You can’t just hope it will not be political and build the system around that. You have to assume it will become political and make a system that works under that pressure,0

Yeah I get what ur saying but I mean I'm more concerned about the literacy rates lol,0
"The first one shows it broken up by state, where it shows that certain states are much more literate than others.

They both are within the powers vested in the states and localities.  Only a true retard would blame the federal government for actions of a state, which I guess explains your upvotes lol",0

"What’s so stupid about the SC nominations is that the whole process is to prevent political influence. Yet it does exactly that.

A simpler idea would be to have people apply via a series of testing and experience and the. randomly selected. 

They should also have terms and can never be selected again",0

Hahah... I’m sorry.,0
"Not only that but at the moment, there are only 50 healthy Republican senators. The constitution requires at least 51 senators in attendance to do literally anything. So if Dems wanted to, they could just not show up and the vote would just fail.",0
