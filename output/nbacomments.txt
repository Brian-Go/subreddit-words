Ben Simmons need helps ASAP
Stevens, who moved into the role of president June 2, said dealing Walker was "hard" but that Boston was getting a "very good player" in Horford in return.

"This was really hard. Not the ideal first few weeks on the job move," he said. "That's because of the kind of person Kemba is, the kind of professional he is and how good of a player he is, and how good he'll continue to be as a player."

Isn't Horford injury prone ?
Warriors seem pretty awesome at drafting. Our Championships home grown not paid for
If I were a GM I would draft good players that fit my team’s needs specifically, but that’s just how I would approach the draft. That’s the type of radical thinking that got me banned from a front office job
[Most recent mock](https://fanspo.com/nba/s/celtics/mock-drafts/Pp9gtIeVLW_mo8/suggs-2). I definitely let Jalen Johnson slide too far- I’ve read about possible character issues and I don’t love his game, but his ceiling’s probably too high for him to escape the lottery undrafted.
So with Murray being very good this year continuing his Bubble form, and Mitchell taking the next step doing the same, is the "Bubble Gods" theory partially debunked? (meaning they only played well because it was an empty gym)

And i say partially, because Miami was ass and TJ Warren is not Michael Jordan, turns out.
Dear Basketball overlords, please give Chicago a top 3 pick. Thank you.
Ok this is the last mock draft before the lottery, close it up, this is the one.
Why would OKC take Kuminga AND Scottie Barnes? Worst spacing in the league just got even worse.
I dont like this
All OKC picks for Ben Simmons
Every mock I've seen has us at 4. Im praying that your mock is the way it goes 😭
I know their contending but i really like copper for the clippers
Yes! Pistons. Imma keep praying to the bball gods.
You didn't draft any of your FMVPs
You have Kispert way too high and other guys like Giddey way too low. Also, Suggs at 2? He’s clearly a level below Mobley and Green.
Damn the lottery is tomorrow! Very exciting. For some reason it felt like it was a few weeks away
OKC isn't good enough to draft for fit, take BPA

You dont draft for everyone to work out, you draft throw as much shit at the wall as you can and hope one of them becomes a star. Plus, I'm a believer in Kuminga to develop a jumper and I see them playing different positions long-term.
Is yalls pick that OKC has completely unprotected?
I strongly disagree with the idea Suggs is "clearly" a level below Green and Mobley, everyone I've talked to that believes this seem to dramatically undersell their weaknesses and issues.

That said, the Pistons are a team that doesn't really care that much about one of Sugg's best attributes, the ability to play with just about anyone, so them taking him #2 is a little weird.
Top 4
Damn it’ll be a dramatic lottery for y’all lol
It's a coin flip, and I've been telling people on /r/rockets all year to not get their hopes up lol. Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
The dramatic is the fact that there were 4 worse team in the league than the rockets

I don’t see how you can keep Ben Simmons considering how much of a player liability and thus a financial liability he has become. He has played like complete utter shit this series, with the past three games only having 6 points or less, while having plenty of time on the court. At this point, Sixers will have to take a loss when trading him, since he has no legit value rn, to move forward as a team. He and that unwarranted contract need to fucking go this summer if Sixers want to win a championship before Joel has a career ending injury or just leaves the team
Putting all Jokes aside - Ben Simmons should be considered a failure. No one at this level can be paid this much and be that bad. We say some people 'cant shoot" but he literally can't shoot. Morey will need to figure out a way to get rid of him or they'll never get better
re: that Simmons play getting all the attention. There was one a couple possessions earlier, maybe even the previous possession, that was equally infuriating and made the 2nd one feel so much worse.

I think it was a normal inbound, maybe some type of fast break. Ben advancing down the court, gets to half court and there is only 1 defender between him and the basket(Huerta at/around the foul line I think) time and context screamed for a drive to the rim and he just does some dumb shit instead. Then that horribleness getting all the play like 30 seconds later
We lost this game three games ago.

You *cannot* lose both G4 and G5, man. I don't really care what anyone says, I think that the Sixers on paper were head-and-shoulders better than the Hawks, but to have lost all that momentum coming out of G3 is inexcusable. Losing those games erased all of this team's moxie, robbed them of any confidence, and ultimately played a factor in why they lost in 7.

Part of it is obviously on Simmons, who I have no patience for anymore. Outback Olowokandi and his defeatist mindset have totally kneecapped his ability to win meaningful games in Embiid's very-much-still-open championship window. It cannot happen. He is a deeply flawed player who, barring a radical change, will never see a conference finals appearance. When push comes to shove, he will gladly get shoved every time.

But that doesn't absolve Doc Rivers in the slightest. It's hard not to think about how our organization was torn between MDA and Ty Lue before Doc came on the market. Either one of them would have been better. Doc's stubbornness, his refusal to tighten his rotation, his cluelessness about what to do with this *very talented* roster, and the dark, ominous playoff-losing cloud that hovers above him were all major factors to this collapse.

I feel totally embarrassed to have this flair next to my username. The Sixers fought all year for the 1 seed so that, if we needed a game 7, it would be at home, and we squandered it completely. 

Some scattered thoughts:

\- Any criticism of Embiid's turnovers is mostly valid, but ask yourself this: if you're Embiid, and your options are either force up something stupid, or pass it to Ben Simmons, what would *you* do? The fact is that, due to the lack of perimeter creation (organizationally magnified by the commitment to Ben Simmons as your PG), Embiid has to initiate his offense from 20ft out instead of 12ft. That's the issue. He's turning it over because Doc can't manage to get anyone else on the roster to help him establish position when he needs to make a play. His turnover problem is probably the 15th-20th domino in line, falling as a result of having Ben Simmons on your team.

\- I knew this game was over when our defense caused Atlanta to start the 4Q 0-10 shooting through \~6 minutes of play... and ended up with a 4pt lead. Down 5, you manage TEN consecutive stops (minus one trip to the foul line) over 6 minutes... and only make it a 2 possession game? Pathetic. Atlanta's defense is not nearly good enough to have killed our offense like that. It's Doc's fault, and Ben's fault.

\- That Ben play will define his career. He will never, ever, ever live that down.

\- This team pretty obviously needed Danny Green to work, because as good as Curry's shotmaking was, the Sixers had no solution for the way he got hunted on defense. Huerter was taking warm-up shots all night on Curry, which is also what happened in G5 with Lou. Danny going down magnified that he and Ben were our only reliable wing defenders, and Atlanta absolutely maximized the matchup. Huerter and Williams, for the series, combined to shoot 16-27 on Curry. You needed Curry out there... but it's on Doc to figure out a way to hide him better and keep Atlanta from getting the shots they wanted. Mission failed.

\- I'm not gonna do the referee thing, but after G3, they were just downright bad.

Credit to the Hawks for being those dudes, man. They fit together really well, they all trust each other, and none of them shrank from the moment. Wish I could say the same about Philly. Lots and lots of questions to be answered this summer.
If Ty Lue got the Sixers job and all other things stayed the same (roster, opponent, injuries) would they have won last night?
I know everyone is piling on Ben Simmons, he deserves the criticism. But can we give some respect to the Hawks. Trae had an awful shooting game and still managed to have a great offensive showing with assists and a couple of clutch 3’s. Huerter stepped up big time for Atlanta. Gallo was impactful on offense and defense. The Hawks won three road games against the top seed in the East. At some point you gotta give this team their due. Take that interim tag off Nate’s office and back up the Brinks truck.
Okay so realistically what does Philly need to do. If trading Simmons is step 1, what team can absorb the contract???
Simmons is catching a lot of flack, and deservedly so. 

But Tobias Harris flying under the radar is odd to me. He's a good player but is mostly a rim runner and and spot up shooter, and even then he went 8-24 last night. He's not a great defender, can't distribute, can't create, and is an average rebounder most nights. All of this while making more than Simmons.

He wasn't the entire reason for the loss, no one truly is, but it really seems like Harris being paired with Embiid without an elite guard is asking for trouble, and it's only amplified when Simmons is expected to be that guard.
It's time to accept Trae Young as a superstar and one of the five players who will define this league for the next decade.

He's doing this at 22, and his skillset isn't even close to complete yet. He's a polished layup package away from challenging for scoring titles every year, he's already a top 3 passer in the league, and as seen since Nate took over he's putting in the work to become net neutral on defense, which at his size is all you can ask.

More than anything else... Killer instinct. Dogshit shooting night where nothing is working, yet his confidence never wavered and he still orchestrated the offense until hitting a late dagger three in the most crucial moments of Game 7.

The man is a menace.
Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid throwing Simmons under the bus last night in the post-game shows just how broken the team really was. 

Simmons was bad, but he wasn’t this bad in the regular season, and has gotten worse as the pressure has gotten stronger. It’s clear his coach and star teammate didn’t have his back, and that the constant taunting from HOME fans ruptured his confidence in a way that was irreparable.

If you lose a game, and the coach and star have the knives out for a guy who was a key part of the team an hour ago, it shows the team wasn’t strong enough to win. Plain and simple. Winning teams don’t do that. Winning players don’t do that.

Suppose Philly can’t find a trade for Simmons this off-season. Now he has to start the year playing for a coach and with a teammate who publicly said he can’t hack it.

The primary reason Philly lost was Simmons’ play, but it wasn’t the only reason. Doc’s coaching and Embiid’s crunch time wilting had a huge impact as well, and them passing the buck is incredibly disappointing. The team won’t win so long as it’s key figures have that mentality, even if they ship off Simmons.
Ben Simmons played so badly that Doc Rivers will escape blame for another failed playoff run. He was completely out-coached in this series. The game has passed him by.
Is Ben Simmons the most universally clowned player at this point (totally deserved). I seriously cannot think of a player in any professional sport who has been shit talked this much and this openly.
Simmons has to go. It's the end. There's no coming back from this
Go hawks but I just wanna say I used to be a Ben Simmons fan and now he absolutely pisses me off to watch. A grown ass 6’10 player who is afraid of the basket. He needs to go to a bad team and find himself
I never believed the "a jumpshot away from Lebron" hype, nor did I like all the flowers he got before proving anything and despite no improvement in his game year in year out, to the point of robbing Donovan off a ROY to give it to Simmons bending the rules.

With that being said, I feel this has been the most shocking slap Ben has received in his young career, he was exposed and he was hit with reality. And, somehow I feel for him today, as he is the laughing stock of everyone. More than what the Sixers need to do, I am certain Ben needs to go elsewhere to regain his confidence. He needs a change of scenery, city, org, gym and teammates and regain his confidence. Because without confidence he won't be able to finally work on his game to improve his deficiencies.

It seems that'd be Portland if it were to happen. I like it for him, Lillard is a good veteran superstar to learn from/to gain confidence playing with. I think it'd be the right city. I'm not sure I like it for Lillard and the Blazers though, as even if Simmons is good on defense, he would not automatically drastically change on offense come playoffs time, and Dame has no time to wast anymore.

Anyway, let's see how it unfolds, where Ben lands and how the Sixers post-Simmons look like.
Okay, serious question: Is Doc Rivers gone now or does he get another shot with a restructured roster?
He has an ok shot.  I blame more the organization for total failure, they could've created incentives for him to get him shooting more instead of waiting for a meltdown which was inevitable

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPFayRkJwt4
Doc has got to go. He got outcoached by a mile. After a year of all-bench units, we didn't have any offensive chemistry when we rolled out those idiotic lineups throughout the playoffs. He let Hill get roasted by Gallo, Green get roasted by Trae, and Seth get roasted by Huerter without any in-game adjustments. We had no idea who our key rotation guys were in this Hawks series. For our starters, we also had no offensive system. We frequently called timeouts for a garbage isolation play that would result in a turnover. He also got nothing out of Ben (yes, he was trash) on offense - there wasn't even offball screen-setting happening. It was just go to the dunkers spot and stand there. Doc is a bad playoffs coach. We will never go deep with him.
I had a Spurs fan reply to one of my comments and he said that Embiid is a choker and the reason we lost this series. Apparently averaging 27.5 in the postseason is just "empty points" and he would never want a player like Embiid on his team. 

I just can't with people on here sometimes. Embiid and Curry were the most consistently good players for us in the postseason and I am excited to see them become leaders on the team. Harris has been clutch and also completely nonexistent. Simmons is Simmons and that ain't good. I hope Morey can pull off some magic in the offseason.
if i’m a sixers fan, i’m considerably more pissed at doc for his comments on simmons than i am at ben for his play

you have a 24 year old all-star who’s obviously suffering from a severe lack of confidence and who you know is gonna get absolutely shit on in the upcoming weeks, the last thing any coach should do in that situation is pile on and throw simmons under the bus. it goes against the very core tenet of team sports; you succeed together as a team and you fail together as a team
I think Ben can still easily be an all star. He just should have never been a PG. George Hill should have been the ball handler.
[removed]
This is not 100% Simmons’s fault. You gotta also look to the coaching staff. Players derive a lot of their confidence from their coaches and Rivers throwing Ben under the bus in his press conference without taking any of the blame himself was a really bad look. Stars always seem to underperform under Rivers. Look at PG, he’s killin it rn but last year, hell even a few games ago we were saying he was a bum.
https://i.imgur.com/jxEXDyF.jpg
Deandre Ayton's impact was noticeable from the start of game 1; the first real low post, and rim-diving scoring threat that the Clips have faced this first post-season. And it's put Lue in a big conundrum. 

Go big at Center with with Zubac and Cousins and risk getting torched in pick and roll coverage (similar to Luka and Mitchell), although Booker prefers to do his damage in the midrange - snaking his way through an Ayton screen and getting to the free-throw line elbow. If Zubac/Cousins drops or doesn't step up fast enough, it's an easy midrange jumper. Trap too fast, and Ayton roles unimpeded to the rim.

Go small with Morris/Batum/PG as the 5, and any dribble penetration that gets into the paint creates a passing lane for Ayton, who finishes remarkarbly well. Unlike Gobert in the series before, Ayton doesn't necessarily needs to be spoonfed the ball for a lob dunk/layup, easily versatile enough to finish with a hook short or quick dribble into better position. Equally important, he's a big body that boxes out well and a threat for an offensive rebound on an otherwise good defensive possession for LA.

On the other end, PHX perimeter defense is better than Utah's, making it just a smidge more difficult for dribble penetration - Ayton's asked less to protect rim and is allowed to stay closer to the LA corner 3s. He still has issues closing up fast enough on high pick and rolls to step into 3s (PG hit back to back ones in the 3rd), but this is difficult for virtually all big men and not Ayton exclusive. 

I thought it was interesting that for a period in the late 3rd/early 4th, Lue decided to try out a big lineup of Morris + Zubac/Cousins for a few minutes, just to see what type of result you would get. At least defensively, Book and Payne answered that real quick with a quick 8 points, showing the obvious issues it would present on try to defend 2 quick, good shooting guards.
I think if one team figures out the other through adjustments it's the Suns. Clippers also have a few things they can fix but fatigue + already giving them the smallball looks and not having great success + no Kawhi makes their margin of error minute. Like I know he's been great for 9 games but Reggie Jackson was ridiculous last night.  

Devin Booker was robbed of his all nba selection. 

Terance Mann is dope and Pfizer P will be awesome to witness. 

The chess match in the first half was compelling but the second half with the superstars going off and the Mikal showing in the fourth quarter was better. 

I know that it's discounting the Clippers majorly and it will not go that way cause they're just that good at shooting but my feel has been Suns in 5 idk. I'd say 6 it's much more likely though.

Deandre Ayton can do some things better but he was great overall. Helped shut down PG when he stopped dropping on him in the 4th.
You guys remember the time that CP3 came back in Game 7 of the Finals, and the Phoenix Suns won the Bourbon Bowl?!!!
Credit to the suns for pulling out a fun and fair win, and I agree that Ayton is a new problem, but I’m also feeling biased in that everyone is looking at how well the suns did and not the fact that the clips brought it within 2 in the final minute despite all of the benefit of the suns play. If not for a final blown defensive assignment by rondo, this game could easily have gone another way. 

Also, I may be alone/wrong but I almost feel like cp3 returning will obviously make the suns a better team, but also a slower one. Game 1 was a bunch of rested youngins running and gunning, and clips benefit from a slower paced game, which cp3 will bring. Will be interesting to see at the very least.
Ayton just proves that Gobert's/the Jazz biggest weakness is his lack of any offensive game at all

The Clippers didn't need to respect him on the court. They can't treat Ayton like that or he's putting up 30 every night
Suns are winning the championship if CP3 is relatively ok post COVID. They’ve looked absolutely incredible during the entirety of the playoffs.

They have the players to match up well with the 3 other teams in the playoffs and their coaching+leadership is off the charts good (especially in comparison to MIL if they end up playing them.

I really think people are overrating Clips in this series especially with Kawhi likely to be out for the entirety of it. Lue has been incredible, but the Suns roster is just much better constructed than the Jazz to be able to respond to any adjustments the Clippers make (went big to try handle Ayton, Booker+Payne immediately cooked them). Also, Ayton is just good enough with perimeter defending to not be made obsolete like Gobert.

Suns perimeter defense is likely the best in the playoffs and Bridges is getting national recognition now for being an absolute menace on that side. 

Suns in 5 if Paul is back for G2 (KOC mentioned this is rumored to happen). Suns in 6 if Paul doesn’t come back until G3.
You’re right, I don’t think they can keep Simmons and the core of this roster is in trouble. 

Frankly its a mess - Simmons stock is very low right now and you don’t want to have to package picks to get him out of town. I think the best they can do is try to rehab his image and trade at the next deadline, unless they can clear him in a salary dump for role players. 

The reality is Simmons has a flawed skillset. The only way to have avoided this was prevention - either not committing to him like that or making clear that he had to develop shooting. 

I know players like Simmons get a lot of appreciation from the advanced stats guys. And they have a point. But I’m a big believer that judging basketball talent is both a science and an art. For this reason, I have always undervalued Westbrook, Giannis, and Simmons. 

It’s a hot take, but here’s my rationale - those guys are great athletes and ballers but time and again, on the big stage they don’t have the skillset or impact to take over in the way Curry, Lebron, KD, Kawhi, can. Passing, midrange, 3 point shooting - these are the prototype for star power in the NBA. 

Even look at Paul George. His consistency has been an issue but no one doubts he has the capacity to impact the game like that. With Simmons, I’ve always been a doubter. 

All of this to say I hope he’s doing OK mentally and has success in his career. I’m not a fan but I also wish him well, that’s gotta be rough to go through
Yes, he seems a specially bad fit given how Morey's preferred his teams play in the past. Unless they want to transform Simmons to accommodate him as a 4 or so he'll probably get traded now.
The issue isn’t even that he can’t shoot but that he won’t shoot.  For some reason I keep contrasting and comparing him with another Ben: Ben Wallace.  Wallace didn’t have a high shooting percentage away from the rim but he’s still take the shot if open.  Once in a blue moon you’d see Wallace hit a three or a long two.  He was never afraid to take the shot if open.  Philly has a big body down low who can pick up an off shot and sometimes it’s those “garbage” points that make the difference in a game.  Five offensive rebound putbacks can be the difference in a seven point game.

If he’s not going to be a Magic he needs to be a Wallace or even a Rodman (also never afraid to take an open shot).  Let it fly and see what happens.
He just looked like he didn't want to play basketball, like my mans quit on the team at a level I have never seen
That's just it, though. How do you do that? Joel can't get out of the East by himself. You're going to have to commit to improving solely through FA if you offload Simmons' contract, because it's going to take a shit ton of draft picks for some team with no hope in the near future to eat his contract.
It's a mentality thing, and he'll overcome it. You could see the same thing in our player Siakam, to a lesser degree in performance..just a lapse in confidence, and players can get past that. Dude is only 24.
If you’re gonna be a “non-shooter” then you need to have a massive influence in other aspects. He’s good at D, but he’s no Ben Wallace.
Yes! Thanks for bringing it up, cause in the game when I saw that, I wanted to point it out in a game chat but there was so much happening that it was quickly forgotten. You're absolutely right though. It was a classic fastbreak-lite where it's not a clear 100% basket, but most of the times you either get an easy bucket or a foul. The man was right there with his defender and he decided to circle around and stop. This is what created this chaos that is today. It wasn't just one thing, it was the combination of everything up to that point, and those two events really set it off. It was really bad to watch. The dunk he gave up was simply the icing on the cake.
Player that is scared to shoot free throws
It's all bait but I pulled for Ty Lue from the start and feel sad knowing I was right. Still it's Embiid's knee and Ben's play along with the Danny injury that really defeated this team. We weren't going to win with Embiid not 100%.
No sorry we booked this website for the next 2 weeks for Ben Simmons jokes

For real though, huge credit to the Hawks. Great gameplan and lots of guys willing to sacrifice for the team. Even scarier to think what they could do with Hunter.
cus yall play as a whole team. if one player doesnt show up another will go off. 5 players in double digits and 4 of them were starters.
The Hawks played harder...simple.  There was one T.O. where Gallo was screaming/hyping up the team and the Sixers were just staring off into space.  Same thing happened in Game 6, but the Sixers managed to hang on.  After those comebacks in GMs 4 and 5 the mentality was shook.  Embiid was also drained, you could tell how he wasn’t really backing down Capela much in Games 6 and 7 like he was before.
Huerter saved the season for Atlanta
Ben Simmons for CJ straight up. Simmons doesn't need to be a scorer on that team, Philly gets a shooter and creator.
Okc can take on the contract if they really want. Either Kemba or their multiple trade exceptions I believe
i believe i remember someone saying the knicks had an enormous amount of cap space
Hard disagree.

>is mostly a rim runner and and spot up shooter

Those are neither of his best skills. His spot up shooting returned a bit this year but he's a multifaceted scorer who needs reps to get himself going.

Tobias isn't a max player but he gave us his usual 19/7/3 on solid efficiency while playing good defence. He was also tasked with carrying a lot of our bench units, which he hasn't had any practice doing (for some reason...) Tobias is what he is and that is a good player but not an elite player capable of being a #2.
As someone who watched Tobias on the Pistons, I think one of his biggest problems is a lack of strength. A lot of guys can just go through him and it explains why he couldn't finish layups under the basket when the area was a bit congested.
Dude is so fluid with the ball out there

He had that thing on a string all over the place. Kinda crazy lol
That’s tuff🔥

But for real, reality check: pretty sure they’ve been understanding for a looooooong time. Pretty sure Ben has been given chance after chance, excuse after excuse, tough love, soft love, whatever.

At some point, it’s a two way street and the love disappears. At some point, only one side is putting in effort. 

Point to one thing, anything, that Ben has done in the last season to both acknowledge his struggles and actually taken action to improve them.
If you're paid 150,000,000 to be even mediocre at your job and you can't manage that you deserve all the shit you get.
Joel also partially blamed the refs during his last press conference for the season.
How long have we supported a dude that never tried to improve his game? Have you seen the threads for when he would score a 3 that didn't mean anything? We loved the dude, rallied behind him, and wanted him to grow. He refused to. The FTs were the final straw. A point guard who can't shoot is very unusual. A point guard who can't shoot and refuses to drive to the basket because he is scared of FTs, that is absurd. His inability to contribute to our offense drove a 7 foot tall center to try shooting more 3s because it actually helps the team. For years we thought we just needed the right pieces around Simmons. We have those pieces and Simmons has regressed. 

Yes, Philadelphia is more critical of its teams and players than most other places, but we genuinely go all in with the support too. 

I swear this sub went from "you guys are crazy, Simmons isn't that good, stop hyping him up" to "Simmons is having mental issues because his supporters are too harsh" in one playoff series.
The thing he had in common with LeBron was court vision, but that's not a unique skill.  Other players have it too.  Nobody can match LeBron's court vision married with all his other skills.  

If Simmons can't shoot, there's no room for him on this team.  He can't shoot from the outside, so that's not an option.  If he can't finish at the rim, what's his value?  A glorified passer?   His FT % has always been pretty bad, he's usually around 60% but his confidence is just shot now.

It's hard to imagine how he figures this out in Philly.  The pressure is going to be intense next year because all eyes will be on him.  If he went someplace else, someplace quieter where he could work on fixing his shooting - if it's even fixable - maybe he can salvage something.  The OKC comments are a good one.  I have no idea what SA has available, but I wonder if even Engelland could fix him.  Portland, I feel like the pressure would be on him immediately and if they were swapping CJ for him.. they're just losing more offense.  I don't know, tough call.
"okay shot"

TIL 14% from deep and sub 60% free throw percentage counts for okay.
Yo embiid is too nice. If you got back an average nba wing for Simmons I still think philly would be fighting for top half conference seed. I would trade anyone not named trae for embiid.
>I think Ben can still easily be an all star. He just should have never been a PG. ~~George Hill~~ Kyle Lowry should have been the ball handler.
Phoenix is the most well rounded team LAC has had to face yet. Lue has done a great job adjusting to each matchup so it will be interesting to see where he goes from here.

What might work out in PHX's favor is that right after Lue adjusts, CP3 comes back and throws another wrench into the plan.  Game 2 & 3 will be critical for both teams, if either team takes em both I think that team wins the series.
People are finding out that we had the best record (outside the Jazz) against 0.500+ teams for a reason.

We have a lot of different weapons.  If something doesn’t work, we change it.

We have a really young team with a ton of energy. If you notice, the suns give 100% at both ends every minute of the game. Try to count uncontested shots against us, even when guys have to sprint. There aren’t many.

Monty is a great manager of game flow. I was screaming at the Jazz to call a TO when the clips went on that insane 17-0 run. When they started to do that to us, boom, TO after like 3 or 4 unanswered buckets. Stop the bleeding, draw up a play, get back to neutral momentum, control the game.

Also Booker’s midrange jumper is unfair. 

Combine that with the best assist/turnover ratio in 25 years and it’s a really difficult team to plan for.

That said, this is going to game 7. Clips are scary good.
Cousins and Kennard on the floor at same time looked like easy points for Suns. But Cousins also bullied Saric, so as long as he’s out there you never know.
Great post, thank you! :)
I’m not gonna disrespect Clips, I think it’s a 7 game series. They’re really fucking good.
I think it’s going to be a great series. My guess is every game is won by a margin of less than 5 and it goes for at least 6 games.
I think they benefit from a slower game with Kawhi a lot more than usual. Paul George is a great player and has turned it on this year but his play making isn’t as beneficial to making the game super slow as it would be for
How is anyone supposed to transform this dude though
If he can just get hacked down low and sent to the FT line, can he work as a big?
Even if he is a 4, which he should be his offense presents major team building issues. His offense does not exist. There's no reason to guard him in the half court no matter what position he plays. It seems that every post season he shrinks on offenese and you just can't be playing 4 v 5 evertime your team has the ball.

Even Simmons played with KAT, the best spacing big ever, he would still create issues when KAT tried to post up.
Yeah, he doesn't fit the Morey style of play
Same with Draymond, he has the ugliest form in the NBA but still throws up the open 3.
He looks like a HS kid who is being forced to play the sport since he was 3 years old by a pushy father and he is just not having fun anymore and wants to stop . I had a friend go full ride for lacrosse to a D1 school and he just hated that shit after so many years. Same vibes
Exactly. I've been saying this. A 6'10 guy with handles and better than good defense should be no less than a 20/10/6/1/1 guy. 

All the guy has to do is drive to the rim. If he gets fouled, he just keeps shooting FTs. Make or miss, if he keeps driving, the other team is going to run out of fouls.  So just from a self preservation standpoint, other teams will give him several dunks or layups. 

He has clearly lost his confidence and is now scared to shoot because its become a magnifying topic of discussion all over the internet.
A lot of flack on coach bud for the bucks. But what thing he did successfully was increase the confidence of giannis. Before bud he would never shoot. After years of just telling him if he’s open shoot it, he has become a “small” presence from the outside. Sure he will go 1 for 7 from outside but just the fact that he will and can shoot it helps the rest of his game.
Had to look it up. Ben Wallace was 7/51 from 3 for his career. The definition of once in a blue moon.
Yeah plus Wallace was busy on offense setting great screens for everybody, particularly Rip, or fighting for position down low for an easy bucket. That's very different than playing 4-on-5 like the Sixers have to do when Simmons won't shoot or even really dribble.
This is bad advice. Taking low percentage shots is even worse than not shooting at all. Because by not shooting a low percentage shot, it necessarily means you do something else with the ball, like creating a play for somebody else to score. Or getting to your hot spot on the court where you're more likely to score.

 “Let it fly and see what happens” is a horrible philosophy for a bad shooter.
If only there were some kind of rebuilding process they could undergo…
That’s not the same thing. Siakam lost of confidence came when he stated he didn’t practice basketball during the shutdown. That was on Siakam he knows it. We can still give him a pass since he’s shown glimpse of having a strong work ethic. Ben Simmons is full of ego and refuses to shoot. He’s harming himself. Giannis will let it fly if he’s open because he has to keep the defence honest. Giannis was a good shooter before 2017. (See his pro highlight and early bucks day). Ben Simmons could shoot before check his summer league and even high school. Dude literally is getting payed to harm his own team. Not only that this was literally the sixers best chance to win it (Nets Injured, Kawhi out, lakers injured) there won’t be a good chance as this for a while for such a powerhouse team.
I disagree that this is just a temporary lapse in confidence that he will overcome. If you look at his first 4 years, its the same story, just less limelight focus on it. He has under 11 3PTAs a year since coming into the league and is a career 60% free throw shooter. If he's trying to get better he's hiding it really really well. I think this is either a serious mental issue or he just doesn't care very much to get better. 

I agree that as a 24 year old he has plenty of time to improve, but I think he's wasted the last 4 years by not trying to.
Yeah, I think with Lue we beat the Hawks but don't get much further based on legitimate issues with our team.
I dont get why Embiid injury is still an excuse. Like he put up 30 - 40 points several times. Had a couple bad quarters but how much more would you realistically expect to get out of him?
It is just weird that one coach uses Reggie Jackson and Nic Batum to destroy the best defense in the league, and another coach can't find a way to exploit one of the worst defensive players in the league. I agree with you that the Sixers weren't a championship level team with the injuries, though.
Even if he was a 100%, Ben is a -50% to that stat.
Wouldn't that be reason to give them credit?
I think this is about his value, Simmons + a pick for Kemba. Do Kemba and Embiid even play many games together given their injury histories though ?
Yes that’s where he needs to go to get his mind right. The Knicks.
Oh my god this comment gave me so much anxiety
Even if that is true, it’s undeniable it impacted Simmons mentally. Your own fans, your own coach, your own star turning on you — all in about a week. He’s a human being, and it’s easy to see betrayal like that impacting his game.

And it’s also easy to see that if I was a FA, I’d look much more wearily at Philly.
They were awful but refs don't explain 4 losses.
> "you guys are crazy, Simmons isn't that good, stop hyping him up" to "Simmons is having mental issues because his supporters are too harsh"

Both of these things can be true at the same time.
HE STAY
It’s a meme at this point that the Down 2-0 Clippers are unbeatable, and Ty Lue really is a great coach, but this series seems like it will be particularly challenging for them if they go down 2-0 and CP3 comes back. Down 2-0 you can’t afford to feel out the opponent and adjust, you need a game plan ready to go by that point. CP3’s return messes with that game plan, and so does the Suns’ ability to play a variety of styles themselves.
I'm sure Lue will make adjustments, but without Kawhi and Serge, and now Morris possiby being hobbled - the Clippers are just running out of playable bodies. At some point, you just no longer have the personnel to make the adjustments you wish to. 

I'm not saying the Clippers are at that point necessarily, but i do think it's important to note that there isn't always a realistic solution. Sometimes i feel us fans believe, that there is always a solution to the problem, and coaches just have to find it. But sometimes that's not the case. They might very well know how to minimize their weaknesses or exploit opponent weaknesses, but you just don't have the players capable. There's a reason why talent generally wins out.
Top seed in the West turns out to be an actual playoff team:

/r/nba *shocked pikachu face*
they're great but if we're getting Paul early and they're not getting Kawhi that's huge. If the teams stayed like this it goes 7 or the clipps win it due to 3's
Move him to the g league? Lol
Here’s the thing that I feel no one is talking about. I think Simmons is genuinely intimidated by embiid, because Simmons without embiid is a legitimate fucking superstar, look at his stats when he’s played without embiid he goes absolutely insane. And as soon as embiid comes back he becomes this, I must run ball up and pass to Embiid when he crosses half court - I.e this is embiids team. 

Simmons needs to be seen as a Giannis and pre shooting (young) Lebron. He needs a team that’s built around him, whereas the 6ers are defiantly trying to built around Embiid and they have been since the beginning. Ben needs to have legitimate 3 point shooters, just all shooters, that he can cut and dish too, and or just obliterate the rim with slashing. He can finish at the rim and is a monster when he’s allowed to do this. So I think people need to understand that it’s in him to play at that high level he just needs his own team where he’s the GUY and surrounded by the right pieces. Obviously I’m not delusional yes he played so so so poorly this series, but obviously something is not right mentally for him - but given the chance with his own team, I don’t see him not destroying the whole league at some point and filling his potential.
The problem with this line of question is that Ben would be more effective even if he was getting fouled every possession and missing all his free throws. No team in the league could sustain fouling him every possession. If he put his head down and got to the basket and got fouled every single possession, everyone would foul out. 
  
The simplest way to make Ben effective is for him to put pressure on defenses and get everyone in foul trouble. But if he's going to be so afraid of missing free throws that he passes up dunks, he's useless.
This series is the nail in the coffin for Moret to ship him out.
That 2016 game 7 in the Finals might’ve been Draymond’s peak shooting performance. Dude couldn’t be stopped that night, from any distance
You're right. This is Andrew Bynum all over again. He has the talent but refuses to actually work to improve.
It felt like one of those movies where an otherwise basic athlete gets a magic sneaker/freak injury that suddenly makes them a star, but then the skill disappears and they have to make due with minimal natural ability.
Yeah, imagine if some enterprising coach had put him in as a tight end or wide receiver at some point.  Might have not done much but when over twenty years they saw the kid had no accuracy, it might have been time to end the experiment.  

I think he can be fixed though.  Seems like a good enough dude that he’s willing to do what it takes.
Good point.  And taking open shots even when you have a low percentage tells them rest of the team “I trust you to transition to D really well or grab an offensive rebound.  A miss won’t tank us.”
And then he’ll have a random game where he goes like 4 for 6 from 3. Yeah in a 7 game series you go “well that’s one game we lose but he’ll go 1 of 6 the rest of the games so we just win 4 of those.”

But in the heat of the moment, In games it makes the opposing player think at least.
Limiting shots completely even when open will negatively impact a player. It’s not hard to understand that a coach telling (in this case a star) player ‘you must never shoot the ball, advanced analytics tells me so’ can mess up other parts of his game and kill his confidence.
> Taking low percentage shots is even worse than not shooting at all. Because by not shooting a low percentage shot, it necessarily means you do something else with the ball, like creating a play for somebody else to score.

Not if the alternative is an even lower percentage shot. 
  
Take Brook Lopez's pass to Middleton when the shot clock was expiring. That's a bad decision because it immediately resulted in a turnover. Just take the bad shot. The alternative is worse. 
  
In the case of dunks and layups, there are very few shots that are better than that. That's the game that Ben plays. Shit really close to the hoop. But him giving those up for something further out is rarely a better option. 
  
>Or getting to your hot spot on the court where you're more likely to score.
  
Problem is Ben giving up dunks because he's afraid of free throws is always a bad deal. Even if he misses some of them and ends up at the line and misses both, there are benefits to him taking those shots. Not only because most of the time he won't miss, but because getting fouled is useful to the team (getting in the bonus earlier, forcing the defense to back off, fouling players out). 
  
I don't think anyone thinks Ben should line up on the three and chuck every ball thrown his way, but he can't be afraid of high percentage shots because of fouling.
Yeah it was really bad when Rodman and Wallace won those rings too.  What the heck was I thinking?
Wide open shots aren't "bad shots"
Well he sure couldn't shoot at LSU. So I don't know what happened after HS. He was terrible from 2pt range. He could get to the rim and layup or dunk.

Also, his FT% was jacked at LSU as well
  Siakam was making so many mistakes entirely to blame on mentality alone. He was so focused on his lapse of ability that he would hurl random threes instead of looking for anyone else open. That stress causes a player to be entirely self focused, and it serves as nothing but a distraction, but it's not like it's easy to switch off.

I have no clue about his prospects with the 76ers, but this sub will probably find themselves wrong yet again to act like he's done because of a shit series.
He was playing way below his level defensevily and settling for bad shots even if he made some of them.
I don't think we attacked him enough but Curry lit up Trae tbh. Kinda slipped under the radar how bad Young was defensively this series. Not to take anything away from how superb he was overall.
yea im giving creds to hawks. my point was adding to his point of giving hawks cred
hear me out -

ben simmons strength? defending. the knicks coach? 2008 championship winning boston celtics' defensive coach tom thibodeau!

are there other misfits who have gone to the knicks and/or thibodeau and magically become skillful? yes! julius randle and derrick rose have both improved since returning to the embrace of thibodeau.

i thought it was dumb at first too, but maybe simmons to the knicks works. and if it doesn't, we still get to lolknicks
I'd be more understanding of your point if the series was an anomaly, or he had show great growth and regressed, but for literal years people have been defending his play and refusal to shoot or improve any facet of his game and I'm sorry I just have no sympathy for him. Losing as a team is fine and all but when you're paid that many zeros you have to own some of it.
Ummmm, I can't agree even though you have a solid point. 

Hes been the same player in every post season. Had he 2 great post seasons then bombed here, okay but he's consistently disappeared every post season for the most part.
100%!! I said this in an early reply above. But I genuinely think Simmons is intimidated by embiid. I think he knows it’s JoJo’s teams, and you can tell by the difference in the way he plays when embiid is out or resting. So just to add to your point I really think as good as embiid is that he deep deep down he is a toxicity for his teammates - this being mentally which he clearly showed today. Also I think doc said what he said because A: he doesn’t want to lose his job and B: he’s probaley had talks with Simmons about free throws and shooting and what not and is genuinely flabbergasted at his performance today (even without the need to shoot a jump shot).
We might of won the last 2 vs Utah without kawhi but kawhi was so so important in tying the series in the first place, and with Morris possibly hobbled, we are running out of guys that can actually play and not kill us on one side of the ball
Ayton averages a double double at 15/10 because the team has so many other good scoring options.

NBA fans: eh I guess he’s a decent big man.

Ayton is so underrated and with how humble he’s being this season I’ll keep it that way
Honestly, if both teams were healthy Kawhi would be the best player in the series, and I would favor the Clippers to win. But it's more likely that CP3 comes back sooner and Kawhi still has a way to go to be ready plus Morris is having some injury issues as well. The talent difference between the two teams would just be too big, and this might be a quicker series than people would expect.
His rim finishing is pretty mediocre
I mean it's not like you can snap your fingers and find 4 knockdown 3pt shooters . 

I would think most owners would rather have a normal playstayle than live and die by the 3
Giannis and Lebron have one big difference from Simmons in that they aren’t the softest players in nba history. In fact both of those guys are ruthless in a way Simmons just isn’t capable of being. Simmons has always shit his pants in big moments.
You can't be the guy when your FT is the worst of all time

He's gonna get fouled 10 time a game lol

Dude is SCARED of contact because of it
> pre shooting (young) Lebron.

There’s no version of Lebron that was unwilling to take jump shots.
When your too scared to dunk because you might have to shoot free throws.  Doesn’t matter how good you are attacking the paint when everyone will just hack a Simmons
Someone suggested Simmons as a small ball 5, I'd say if you pair him with a facilitating/shooting PG and 3 guys that are average 3pt shooting and defense,, he could be a hybrid of both roles. Handle the ball and drive to confuse help defenses, set screens to punish switches, just involve him in a majority of offensive possessions and move him without the ball so his man can't ignore him, isolation scorer to rest his legs. Maybe that's why people are saying Portland?
Agree to an extent. But that is if he continues to go strong to the hoop. I can just see him do the homer simpson bush meme once he gets fouled a few times and go 2/8 at the line.

Make him learn underhanded to go 60% at the line and surround him with shooters and maybe it could work?
Bynums knees also straight up died on him though.
He's literally refused to with on his shot the last 3 years.
No, a good coach would set achievable goals and realistic expectations for all his players, including his stars. Good coaches put their players in the best situations to take advantage of their strengths and hide their weaknesses.

You don't eat his lunch if he occasionally takes a 3. You coach him to play to his strengths while working on his weaknesses in practice until they are ready to be used in a game. This is true in every single sport. 

Tim Duncan had fewer than ten 3PTA pretty much every year of his career. Either Tim was smart enough to know that wasn't his game, or Pop (one of the best coaches of all time) told Tim not to shoot 3s even if he's open and instead work to get the ball to his actual hot spots. That didn't kill Duncan's confidence. If anything it helped his confidence because he saw the success that playing to your strengths brings out
100% agree with all of that.

But that’s not what the guy was saying that I was replying to. He **was** arguing that Ben should chuck 3s whenever he’s open (which is always because there’s no reason to guard him that far from the basket) because Ben Wallace did sometimes. And that’s a good idea because maybe you’ll get lucky and make it or get an offensive rebound.
If you think the Pistons... or Michael Jordan’s Bulls... won titles because Ben Wallace and Dennis Rodman occasionally launched ill advised 3 point shots, then I don’t really know how to help you. This is the worst take i’ve read in a long time

Dennis Rodman also skipped practice during the NBA Finals to fly across the country and film WWF segments. Should Ben Simmons do that too? Since using your weird retroactive logic, everything anybody ever did en route to winning a championship must have been a positive contribution towards winning that title
I don’t see how any of those miserable 3s launched last night helped anyone
If it’s at a spot you aren’t likely to make it, then yes — wide open shots are bad shots. 

Unless you think it’s good basketball for Giannis to chuck 25 foot 3s every time down the court because the other team will always leave him wide open from there.

"Shoot when you're open" is good advice for players who are reasonably good shooters. Marcus Smart shoots 32% from 3 for his career. He's not a good shooter but that's at least a competent shooting percentage and he should shoot if he's wide open for 3. Ben Simmons is a career 15% shooter from 3. He should never shoot from 3 even if he's wide open. That's a bad shot and a waste of a possession.
He was a 67% FT shooter in his one year at LSU. That's not a good base to start from, but he's never sniffed that in the NBA.
He was shooting in the summer league with confidence making midranges here and there. It was better than whatever shit show he displayed this series. It’s pathetic straight garbage it’s actually sad a max contract player is afraid of the sport he plays.
Yeah I hope hawks don't try to stick Trae on jrue. Holiday will absolutely feast
My bad read that wrong, carry on.
The NY media would destroy him.
Can you imagine Portland fans treating a player like Philly fans have treated Simmons? Can you imagine Dame publicly being like “this guy sucks” after losing? 

It’s an organizational crisis for Philly, in my opinion. Between the shit that Simmons and Harris get, you couldn’t pay me enough to go play there. It’s not worth it.
This series was absolutely an anomaly and it's stupid to argue it wasn't. He did worse than ever in basically every part of his game.
He’s 24. Players grow. Not everyone is Trae Young, ready for the playoffs out of the womb. This is also not the first player Philly has destroyed psychologically.
It means we’re just well-balanced. No need for our starting 5 to overachieve, because our bench would blow the lead; we have one of the top benches in the league. No need to continuously feed the ball to Book or Ayton, because we’re not just dependant on one scoring option.
It was this series 100% but when he’s aggressive and feeling himself he is nearly unstoppable.
Golden state or legit the hawks team that just knocked him out! That’s the type of teams I’m talking about, but yes my comment is very unrealistic (4 knockdown snipers and Ben Simmons lol) but I’m just trying to allude to what Ben’s REAL play style is and what would compliment his game.
Honestly don't even need knockdown shooters, just not guys with completely broken shots that defenses can ignore. I could see Simmons running a 5 out type of offense where he either handles the ball or plays roll man alongside a PG that can toss him lobs, just force the defense to play 2v2 every play that Simmons is on the floor.
If you can put me in a NBA game and shut down a player by just hacking at him in the paint you have a serious fucking issue.
> I can just see him do the homer simpson bush meme once he gets fouled a few times and go 2/8 at the line.

The problem is that he does just that. Instead of actually trying to get buckets, he disappears. He needs to put the pressure on the defense outside of when they want to hack him. Don't let the opposing team decide when they want you on the line. On the majority of those possessions, he'll be contributing productively even if he misses the free throw. I can't see him missing everything in the paint. 
  
The most frustrating thing to me is that Ben can pretty much torch everyone on the court. If he just got the rebound and turned every possession into a fast break, he'd get buckets and it wouldn't matter if he was 0/8 from the line if he got 10-15 points in the process. But him being afraid to hold the ball past midcourt is ridiculous.
He is a 60% shooter though. This series was an anomaly. I don't know what happened to him but he shoots around 60% for his career.
Do you think there’s an “expert” who could fix him?  I wonder if Dell Curry could help.
I agree totally about putting the work in until you meet those expectations. My point is being given the confidence (and support) to shoot in a game setting will dramatically make you a better shooter. Of course you have to put the work in behind scenes and some people may not ever be shooters but you can be lights out in practice and brick on the court. More of it is mental then people may like to think. 

A lot of people were calling on Lonzo to stop shooting completely, it took more then two seasons before there was a noticeable change and he’s become decent. You can tell he’s become confident. Through the worst parts of it his coaches didn’t pull the plug on him shooting the ball. There’s a reason some shooting coaches favourite thing to say is ‘don’t think just shoot.’
You went off on a WHOLE tangent there.  Keep going with the bad faith arguments.  I’m sure your expertise in the art of basketball will pay off one day.  Until then, stay out of my reply chain.
If he can shoot 67% now, he would be close to unstoppable.

But in the playoffs. Regular season doesn't matter. He has shot 70% before but now he has zero confidence to shoot from anywhere.
I mean from the line? The line is where he will break teams. They either have to foul him or let him get to the rim.

That puts fouls on the other team and puts their players on the bench. 

My man passed the ball while in the air at the rim to a guy that had 2 players in position to collapse.

I really couldn't believe what I saw. I blinked like 50 times.
Trae always goes on the worst guard on the team and the Bucks really only play one guard and that’s Jrue. When Connaughton is in, Trae will be on him. 

I could also see them experimenting with him on PJ Tucker. 

I imagine the main lineup will be Capela on Giannis, Collins on Lopez, Huerter on Middleton, Bogi or Gallo on Tucker, and Trae on Jrue.
wouldn't it be delicious
I absolutely understand the impatience philly fans have had and to be honest bens entire attitude just appears to be he just doesn't give a shit. Like he couldn't care less. And that's fine. Not everyone is mamba mentality etc, but when you sign a contract for that amount, and fans have been patient for years waiting for progress expectations are set and when it ends in yesterday's trainwreck he surely can't be surprised at everyone's reaction.
If the player sucked then sure. Philly is a large market with all large markets there are expectations, if he wants to make a bunch of money while being trash and not worry about criticism he should go play for some small market team.
No my point is he doesn't have to be Young to kill a team. Just shoot 65% from the line. Dude is big and athletic, and has handles. They cannot keep him from the rim. Refs aren't calling a charge every time and Teams will either foul you or allow you to the rim once they run out of fouls. He doesn't need to even be LeBron from 3 or 2pt range. Just hit 65% FTs and maybe shoot 35% from 2pt range, 28% from 3.
There was one play that exemplified just what a machine this team is.

Booker got the ball with like 4 seconds on the shot clock and it swung to 3 other players around the perimeter until it found the corner man for the three. It was really, really precise.
What is going at the rim when you can’t convert your FTs especially when you are mediocre at finishing?

Even if he was good at finishing within 5ft of the basket, teams would just hack him all the time when he tries to drive. 

He wouldn’t even try and go up at the basket late in game. Dude cannot take the pressure.
You can say that about any top 50 NBA player
Then your gonna turn Ben Simmons into a poor mans draymond whose even worse at shooting?
Not even joking I don’t think he’ll ever improve until he actually starts shooting with the correct hand. At this point I don’t even know how you “fix him” other than that. He’s showed zero ability to improve over his career and it’s becoming glaringly obvious that he’s not even a good offensive player at any level with his current shot. I mean look at the warmup videos of him shooting on an open court before the game. The guy goes like 0-10 for 3 and 1-8 from the elbow even in warmups. As ridiculous as it is to say about an NBA player, his shooting ability is below that of an average Highschool varsity bench player at this point.
You mean like give him one of the best three point shooters in the league to pass to?
I don't know.  Does he have the killer instinct to want to evolve his game?  Can he set his ego aside enough to go put up 1000 shots in the gym knowing he's going to miss 750 of them?  I have no idea where his head's at.
> A lot of people were calling on Lonzo to stop shooting completely, it took more then two seasons before there was a noticeable change and he’s become decent.

Right, but that improvement was very likely the result of tons of work by Lonzo in practice. 

There's a right way and a wrong way to coach a bad shooter. To be clear, I'm not suggesting anybody screams at Simmons and benches him every time he takes a wide open 3 point shot. You coach him to focus on shooting at the spots on the court he's good -- in the paint and around the rim -- while working on him extending that range in practice. As he shows improvement in practice, you coach him to take more and more shots from outside in games. It's not black and white "pull the plug on all shooting" or "give the green light to shoot any time you're open"

> There’s a reason some shooting coaches favorite thing to say is ‘don’t think just shoot.’

Absolutely agree and this has always been my philosophy as a shooter. But there is an important implied clause to the end of that "don't think just shot *from spots you've practiced and are competent to shoot from*
LOL that wasn't any more of a bad faith argument than your weird nonsense argument.

You basically said that "Ben Wallace and Dennis Rodman occasionally took bad shots from 3, and they also won championships. Therefore those bad shots must have been part of the reason they won championships because reasons."

Which is a total non-sequitur argument.
I was starstruck when I saw that. I’m not even a sixers fan and I was furious at what I saw. How do you pass up such a high percentage shot with that much athleticism and height. Fuck it I’ll take the guaranteed two and possible chance for a free throw. Than whatever shit happen.
Those are all fair points but they’re not addressing what I’ve said. Even if you excuse the fans’ reaction, Embiid’s reaction, and Doc’s reaction, they all clearly impacted his performance. It’s not winning basketball to flame one of your own players, and it never will be.
So if Simmons drives to the hoop 20 times 1st quarter, are you fouling every time? Even with subpar shooting teams don't wanna go putting starters in foul trouble first quarter lol.
Maybe he needs to adapt to that Shawn Marion launch 😂
Bahahahaha, fair point 😂
I wonder the same.  Funny thing is I think lack of ego is the problem.  I’ve never seen a dude almost a foot taller than me look so much like I could beat him up.  And I’m not a big tough guy.
I didn’t make that statement. You seem to be inserting stuff and as of now you’re just trying to bait, which isn’t part of a serious discussion.  Instead of approaching Reddit as a place to argue against everything, why not offer an alternative hypothesis. Maybe cyberspace is a place you feel power because you have none in real life?  I don’t know because I don’t know you, but [the grown men here are trying to have a discussion.](https://youtu.be/zzbLYYnAsFI)
No I agree I do. But their reaction was after the game not before, from what I've seen they've (and everyone else on the team) have been super supportive. Idk it's a shit situation but  he didn't sign there not knowing what he was in for, he was already there and signed that monster extension (which anyone would) ultimately I guess the blame has to go somewhere unfortunately.
He is such a mediocre finisher, you can just block him at the rim or contest to force him to alter his shot.
You didn't say that literally, but that was what you implied. Otherwise, what did you even mean? 

You started by suggesting it was good that Ben Wallace occasionally shot 3s, and when I disagreed that your advice was not good basketball philosophy, your response was "Yeah it was really bad when Rodman and Wallace won those rings" As if that proves that everything they did along the way must have been correct because they won rings

I tried to have a good faith argument by disagreeing with your stance that shooting is always good no matter your skill level. And you responding with that dumbass comment and then doubled down with youtube reaction gifs. Tell me again, who's making bad faith arguments and baiting instead of having a normal conversation? Clown
I just think, if the knives come out from your coach and teammate ten minutes after the game is over, they probably weren’t super supportive before that.
Doesn't need to be an elite finisher with his size and speed. Have you seen him dunk? Lmao. Most of these plays are gonna result in guys making career decisions for themselves.
Where does this narrative that he is a terrible finisher comes from? I think Ben is a good finisher at the rim. He has been god awful lately, since he is in a huge slump but over his career I always thought he had good touch.
He must be a troll.
I saw him NOT dunk under the rim over Trae Young.
Mediocre does not mean terrible. Peep the def bro
